AdLib Waveform Driver for Windows 3.1 and Multimedia Windows
----------------------------------------------------------

ADLIBWV.DRV is a Windows WAVE driver. It requires either:
  1) Windows 3.1 or
  2) Windows 3.0 with Multimedia Extensions.

Notes:
  The AdLib card is supremely unsuited to generating waveform sound,
  so the sound may only be slightly better than the internal speaker
  driver. Like the speaker driver, the AdLib Waveform driver plays
  exclusively, so Windows will not run programs or respond to the
  user while sounds are playing. Unlike the internal speaker, you
  hopefully have your AdLib connected to nicer speakers.

  This driver is ONLY a waveform driver. To get MIDI sound from your
  AdLib, use the AdLib MIDI driver that comes with Windows. They can
  coexist but you can't play waveform and MIDI sound at the same time.
