BEFORE CONTINUING WITH THE FLASH BIOS UPDATE, PLEASE
CONNECT THE AC ADAPTER TO THE SYSTEM!!!!!!!!


After the flash bios upgrade executes, the system will reboot
and then give an error:

  System CMOS checksum bad - run SETUP
  Press <F1> to resume,  <F2> to Setup 

This is NORMAL. When the message appears press the F2 key to enter
setup. Hit enter to continue, go to the "exit" column and 
"Save Changes and Exit" should already be highlighted in white.
Hit enter twice and the system will then reboot and operate normally.

If you are connected to a printer (not through the network)
and you wish to print out these instructions, press the PrtSc (print screen)
key.
