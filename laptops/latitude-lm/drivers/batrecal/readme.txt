Connect AC power to the system.
Run batrcal from a dos prompt in Windows or exit Windows to a dos prompt
and run batrcal. There will not be any messages or indication that anything
is happening. Please leave the system powered on overnight.


The Latitude LM & LM/mmx and Inspiron 3000/3200 will respond to 
the attached BATRCAL.COM file which will result in a forced recalibration 
of the main battery. As this is a long process and is best done
uninterrupted, it is recommended that this be done overnight with AC power
connected. The forced recalibration will charge the battery to a full state,
then internally disconnect the AC power and fully discharge the battery,
then recharge the battery. This will cause a suspend of the system when the
battery reaches a discharged state, but the battery will be recharged.
During the charge to 100% and subsequent discharge portion of the
recalibration cycle, the Up arrow and the battery outline in the system
LCD Status Panel will blink. Once the recharge cycle starts, the system
status panel will return to normal indication. The BATRCAL.COM utility can
be run from MS-DOS or an MS_DOS window under Windows 95. The battery
recalibration process is not available for the secondary battery.
