### PC card

As the system lacks connectivity options, I add the a 3COM 3C583C PC card to the system.

Card slot is on the left of the machine.

For the PC card drivers, I only used the Packet Driver for DOS. The Packet driver works without the need to use the Cardsoft PCMCIA drivers which helps to save memory.

To install Cardsoft for DOS, run `install.exe`. For Cardview for Windows, run `setup.exe`. Cardview requires Cardsoft to be installed first.

### Disk and Memory
