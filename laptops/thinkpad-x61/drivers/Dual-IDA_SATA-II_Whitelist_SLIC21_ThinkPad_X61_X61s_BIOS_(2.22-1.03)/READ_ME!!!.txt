Version 2.22-1.03
BIOS: 2.22 / ECP: 1.03


Supported ThinkPad systems:

- X61/X61s


Note: You can choose "BIOS update + CTRL-FN swap" version of this BIOS if you like CTRL-FN swap.


Updating the BIOS:

1) Run WINUPTP.EXE as administrator.
2) Select 'Update ThinkPad BIOS' and follow the instructions on the screen.
3) After the update has been completed, the program shows a message 'Flash Update has been successfully completed...'.
   Follow the instructions on the screen to restart the computer.


There is no BIOS update for X61/X61s which you can flash under 64-bit Windows. Lenovo recommends the following:
"If Windows Vista or 7 64-bit is already installed on your system, then you must use the bootable CD ISO format
of this BIOS update".
Bootable CD-image is included in this package.

Important note: When you boot from this CD, BIOS update will start automatically.

Pay attention that there are two ISO images (#1 and #2) for the CTRL-FN swap version. Use "#1.iso" first.
If the CTRL-FN swap works properly after applying ISO #1, then everything is OK.
In case ISO #1 flash is successfully completed but the CTRL-FN swap doesn't work, you have to use ISO #2.
