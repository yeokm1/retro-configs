The current version of odipkt is 3.1.  Source is odipkt.asm and binary
is odipkt.com.  The previous version of odipkt, 2.4, is provided for
reference in odipkt24.asm and odipkt24.com; however, there is no known
reason to run 2.4 in preference to 3.1.

Users requiring certain specific features of odipkt 1.x (native mode
ARCnet or old PhoneNet (versions before 3.0) support) should use
odipkt13.asm/odipkt13.com/odipktpn.com.  Version 1.3 was the last 1.x
release.  Older versions of 1.x are provided for reference.

The major changes in 3.x were chained default stack processing and
hex/octal parameter parsing.

The major change in 2.x was dynamic buffer allocation.  2.x versions
prior to 2.4 had problems with ARCnet; please avoid them.

Note that documentation is provided in troff format in the
file odipkt.8
