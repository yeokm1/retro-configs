Multiple buffers/read-ahead?
 I tested MSCDEX v2.25 with default settings (/M:6?) and /M:1 (rounds to 4?),
 with SMARTDrive, and SHSUCDX 3.00 beta 1, with SMARTCDX. Two tests were
 done: bdiffing a 9M file against itself and dir/s/b on a CD with 5135
 files. The default MSCDEX bdiff was only slightly faster than /M:1 and
 SHSUCDX (3.30s versus 3.40s). The SHSUCDX dir/s/b was half the time of
 either MSCDEX (0.62s versus 1.24s). Thus, there doesn't seem to be any
 advantage to using multiple buffers.
