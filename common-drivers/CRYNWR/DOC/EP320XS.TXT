Introduction:

  This document describes the procedure to setup the Packet driver for
  100/10M PCI Ethernet Adapter.

  Location of Driver:     \PKTDRV\FEAPKT.COM


Usage:

  Load the packet driver using the software interrupt and any
  optional switches if required.

  Usage: FEAPKT [-u] <software_int_no> [media]

  Example: FEAPKT 0x60

  The only required parameter is the software interrupt.  A packet
  driver needs to have a software interrupt assigned to it for other
  programs to access it.
  If you need any of the options listed below, place them before the
  software interrupt on the command line.

    -u           : to unload this driver",CR,LF
    packet_int_no: to set software interrupt for this driver
                   the reasonable value is from 0x60 to 0x80
    media        : to set the line speed and fullduplex function
                   the reasonable value is auto/10half/10full/100half/100full
                   auto    = enable autonegotiation
                   10half  = force to 10M, half duplex
                   10full  = force to 10M, full duplex
                   100half = force to 100M, half duplex
                   100full = force to 100M, full duplex
