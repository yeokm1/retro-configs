Here are some things that might be problems:

  o Some packet drivers will not work properly if you have two
    of the same Ethernet board in a machine.  Contact Crynwr Software
    for support.

  o The 3c505 driver is very slow.  FTP Software reports that it can
    crash under some circumstances with their kernel.  The work-around
    is to use the 3c505 NDIS driver and dis_pkt (not included, but see
    SOFTWARE.DOC).

  o 3Com says that because of timing problems in the IBM PS/2 model
    30/286, or other machines which use the VTI 8000 chip set, the
    3c507 may not operate properly.  There is a software fix, but I
    have not implemented it because no one has complained.

  o The DE-600 driver will only work the first time after powering up the
    machine.  After that, it doesn't recognize the existance of the adapter.

  o The ne2100, at1500, and ni6510 drivers cannot be loaded high.
    This will probably be fixed after this release.
