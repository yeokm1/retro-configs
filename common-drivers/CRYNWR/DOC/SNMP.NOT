I have written for my own use a program which runs on PCs,
communicates with an Ethernet via a packet driver, and monitors the
values of SNMP variables (as listed in a database file) of specified
network devices supporting SNMP.  This is free, unsupported,
available-to-all software.  See below for retrieval instructions.

The executable program is also an example of how to use the included
libraries to write custom applications in C suited to individual
network managers' needs.  Initial development and testing was done
on a PS/2 model 60 with a 3Com 3c523 Ethernet adapter, with
operational testing and final implementation on a Compaq Portable
III with a Western Digital WD8003E Ethernet card.  So it works with
two different packet drivers.  The SNMP devices it was developed
with were Proteon p4200 routers, so no testing with other devices
has been done so far.  Manufacturer specific databases (non-MIB I)
in the SNMP network devices are not supported.

I will try to answer e-mail questions (should anybody be interested)
as time permits.  My Internet address is crosson@cam.nist.gov.

In the anonymous FTP directory on host enh.nist.gov (129.6.16.1) are
two files in compressed tar format.  This is a VAX running VMS so
the file names may look a little strange.  The file snmplib.tar_z
contains the libraries, executables, and minimal documentation.  The
file snmpsrc.tar_z contains all sources (both the main program and
the libraries) and all available documentation.  Note that a packet
driver for your Ethernet interface is also necessary to run any of
this.

I will be expanding on this as my requirements change.  Others are
free to enhance and expand on the code as they wish.  Have fun.
