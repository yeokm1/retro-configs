   		   VERSION 1.04	   February 10, 1995

VERSION HISTORY

-- Version 1.04
   LM_9232_s2.1_v1.04 (950210)

1. Fixed loopback test in lft_ext.asm.  Software appended CRC bit is not set
   properly in the control byte of the packet data area.
   
2. Added copyright banner to all files.   


-- Version 1.03
   LM_9232_s2.1_v1.03 (950202)

1. Added save and restore node address to LM_Loopback_test for
   EZStart, so when EZStart gets executed again without reboot, the 
   node address will be correct.


-- Version 1.02
   LM_9232_s2.1_v1.02 (950125)

1. Added "cld" instruction to LM_Receive_Copy and LM_Send.


-- Version 1.01
   LM_9232_s2.1_v1.01 (950110)

1. Fixed a problem in TxIntr when restoring pointer register.  
2. Enabled strip CRC bit in Receive Control Register.  Disable strip
   CRC was a workaround for Rev. C and prior FEAST chip when there
   were data corruption at the end of the frame.
3. Added workaround for Rev. D FEAST chip.  For maximum Ethernet
   frame size 1514 bytes, the TooLong bit in Receive Status word will
   be set incorrectly.  LMAC will ignore that status.
4. Fixed LM_Loopback_Test by adding delay after setting the transmit
   control register.
   

-- Version 1.00
   LM_9232_s2.1_v1.00 (941202)

1. Initial Release.
