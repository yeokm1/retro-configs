	a packet driver for Novell's NE1000 and NE2000.
Joe Doupnik <jrd@cc.usu.edu> improved head.asm by adding some comments and
	brought it further into line with the PDS, added promiscuous mode to
	the wd8003e driver, and modified the PC/IP netwatch to use packet
	drivers.
David Horne <71271.1141@CompuServe.COM>, who wrote a packet driver for Novell's
	NE2000.

	driver.

	driver.
David E. Johnson <dave@tacky.cs.olemiss.edu>, who fixed the 3c505 driver.
James A. Harvey <IJAH400@indyvax.iupui.edu>, who fixed the AT test in tail.asm
	and the 3c503 lockup problem.
Anto Prijosoesilo <anto@anto.acs.unt.edu>, who fixed a bug related to DMA in
	the ni6510 driver.
John Mann <johnm@vaxc.cc.monash.edu.au>, who submitted some code to delay the
	etopen and convert between Novell's pseudo IEEE 802.3 packets and
	Ethernet packets.
Drew Daniel Perkins <ddp+@andrew.cmu.edu>, who designed and implemented
	as_send_pkt (asynchronous send) for the wd8013ebt, and improved
	pktsend in the process
