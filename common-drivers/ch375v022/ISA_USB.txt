CH375 New Driver by FreddyV
V0.22

This driver is an optimized version of the V1.9A
For Computer Hobbyist Only, Don't sell and use it at your own Risk.

To be used with the CH375 Based industrial boards found on ebay/Aliexpress

How to use ?

Add a line in the CONFIG.SYS :

DEVICE=CH375DOS.SYS @260 %0

@ is the I/O Port
% is the speed parameter, this one is still active for the Board init if you want to try on faster machine.
No IRQ Needed

! Warning Use % instead of # for Speed (# is IRQ and is not used)

It has been tested on a 286 8MHz Maximum, for 286 12MHJz or more (386), you can test by increasing the Delay value.

V88 : Optimized for 8088
V86 : Optimized for 8086 / 16Bit memory BUS
V16 : For the LoTech board in 16Bit Mode (Add 1 to the IP Port : @2C1 instead of @2C0)
286 : Optimized for V20/V30/286

Test for V0.2:
--------------

8086 8MHz (Amstrad 3086):
V86: Write=192 Kb/s Read=200 Kb/s

8088 4.77MHz (5160):
V88: Write=127 Kb/s Read=141 Kb/s
V18: Write=147 Kb/s Read=170 Kb/s
