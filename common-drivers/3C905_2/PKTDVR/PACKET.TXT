             Clarkson Packet Driver Installation Notes


EtherLink 10/100 PCI Packet Driver
-----------------------------------
The EtherLink 10/100 PCI NIC is completely configured through software. 
You can load the driver from the command line or in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. 
When the packet driver is loaded, the only required command line option is 
the software interrupt value (/I).  The software interrupt is used to 
communicate between the driver and the protocol and should not be confused 
with the NIC's hardware interrupt.

In version 1.10 of the Packet Driver Specification, valid software interrupt
values are in the range 0x20 to 0x80.  

In version 1.09, valid software interrupts are in the range 0x60 to 0x80.

                                                                  
 Loading the Driver from the AUTOEXEC.BAT File 
 ---------------------------------------------
 To load the driver from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, copy the driver 
 from the PKTDVR directory on EtherDisk 3 diskette to your hard drive.  
 You must either place the driver in your path or use the full pathname in 
 the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  


 Loading the Driver from the Command Line 
 ----------------------------------------
 To load the driver from the command line, use the following syntax:

 3C90XPD [switches] [options]

     Switches 
     --------
     The driver supports the following switches:

     -? = Show usage
     -u = Uninstall driver
     -n = Novell NetWare conversion
     -d = Delay initialization (for diskless booting)
     -t = Disable transmit Parallel Tasking (R) feature
     -r = Disable receive Parallel Tasking feature
     -m = Maximize PCI latency timer
    
     The -n switch is needed if the packet is in Ethernet encapsulated IPX 
     format and it needs to be converted to 802.3 format. The default is 
     802.3 format.

     The -t switch disables the NIC's early transmit feature.  The default 
     is enabled.
     
     The -r switch disables the NIC's early receive indications feature.  
     The default is enabled.

     Options
     -------
     The driver supports the following options:

     /I = software interrupt (20h -FFh); default = 60h
     /S = slot number (0 - 31 for PCI)
     /K = bus number (0 - 7 for PCI)

     You must specify the bus type if the bus number and the slot number 
     are used. The bus number is used specifically for PCI.

     Example
     -------
     The following example shows a typical command line.  If you want to 
     load the driver at software interrupt 60h with receive Parallel Tasking
     feature disabled, a PCI bus type, slot number = 1, and PCI bus 
     number = 0, the command line should look like this:

     3C90XPD  -r  /S=1  /K=0  /I=60

     For a complete summary of usage guidelines, type at the command line:

     3C90XPD -?
