          3Com NIC Configuration and Diagnostic Program for DOS


Overview
--------
The configuration portion of the 3Com NIC Configuration and Diagnostics
program for DOS allows you to change the configuration parameters 
for the NIC to fit the specific environment in which the NIC is 
installed.

The diagnostics portion of the program is designed to make sure that 
the NIC is installed correctly and functioning properly in the PC.
It consists of the following tests:

   The Group 1 tests check the physical components, connectors, and 
   circuitry of the NIC and require only that the NIC be installed in 
   the PC.

   The Group 2 tests check the ability of the NIC to transmit data on the
   network; these require that the NIC be connected to a loopback plug 
   or to a network (for 3C900-COMBO or 3C900-TPC NICs).  

   The Group 3 tests check the ability of the NIC to correctly transmit and 
   receive data over the network; these require that the NIC be connected 
   to a network on which an echo server has been set up.

The PC that contains the NIC to be configured or tested must be running 
DOS only (reboot with a DOS-only diskette) and must have at least 505KB 
of free memory.

NOTE:  If the PC is an operating server, notify all users of the
       server to save their work and to log out from the network before
       running the Configuration and Diagnostics program. The program 
       disrupts the normal operation of servers and workstations, 
       and work that is not saved may be lost.


Starting the 3Com NIC Configuration and Diagnostics Program for DOS
------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two ways to start the program:

1.  Automatically (from INSTALL.EXE) by selecting 
    Configuration and Diagnostics Program on the main menu.

2.  Manually, from the root directory of the EtherCD or EtherDisk diskette 2, 
    by typing the following command:

    3C90XCFG [command keyword] [parameter list]

    3C90XCFG represents the 3Com NIC Configuration and Diagnostics program
    name.
    The brackets indicate that the command keyword and parameter list are
    optional.

    3C90XCFG without any arguments invokes the program in full Windows
    mode. This includes mouse support and context-sensitive help.  
    Press [F1] for help at any time.


    Command Line Keywords
    ---------------------
    You can use the first two characters of any command or parameter as a 
    shortcut. For example, 3C90XCFG HE RU means 3C90XCFG HELP RUN.

    The command keywords and parameters are not case-sensitive (for
    example, CONFIGURE, configure, and Configure, will all work).


    CONFIGURE
        Configures a NIC in one of three ways:
        1.  Automatically with the /auto parameter
        2.  Using a specified NIC configuration file
        3.  Using command line configuration parameters

    ECHOSERVER
        Enables a designated NIC to function as an echo
        server.

    HELP 
        Displays general or command-specific help information.  
        To get command-specific help, type:

        3C90XCFG HELP [command keyword]

    LANGUAGE 
        Invokes the program in full Windows mode using a 
        specified external resource file. This option provides
        support for multiple languages through a different resource
        file for each language supported.
       
    LIST 
        Displays a list of installed NICs and their recognized 
        NIC numbers.
       
    RUN 
        Executes the diagnostic tests (which can also be specified
        from a file) on a selected NIC and writes the results 
        to the screen, a file, or a printer.


Configuration
-------------
The NIC can be configured in either full-screen Windows mode or 
command line mode.


    Full Screen Windows Mode
    ------------------------
    To configure the NIC using full-screen windowing, type:
    
    3C90XCFG [Enter] 
    
    Then select the Configure NIC option from the Install menu.


    Command Line Mode
    -----------------
        Command Line Mode Defaults
        --------------------------
        Defaults: CONFIGURE has /AUTO and /ADAPTERNUM:1 as defaults.  
        So, for example, if only 3C90XCFG CONFIGURE is used, NIC 
        number 1 is automatically configured.

        ADAPTERNUM:N and /SLOT:S parameters can be used with any of the 
        CONFIGURE options that follow. They are both intended for use 
        whenever multiple NICs are present in the PC and 
        recognized by the Configuration and Diagnostics program.

        /ADAPTERNUM:N specifies the number of the NIC to be configured for 
        PCI computers. Run the LIST command separately to determine the 
        NIC number to use here.

    There are three different ways to configure the NIC using 
    command-line mode: 
    
    1.  Command line with auto configuration

    2.  Command line with explicit parameters

    3.  Command line with configuration file
     
     
        Command Line with Auto Configuration
        ------------------------------------
        Command syntax:  3C90XCFG CONFIGURE  /AUTO

        The /AUTO parameter configures the NIC media type 
        automatically. All other options settings are left unchanged.
 
        NOTE:  The program attempts to detect what media type is being 
               used. Therefore, connect to the network first and then run        
               3C90CFG CONFIGURE /AUTO. The program configures the 
               media type for you.


        Command Line with Explicit Parameters
        -------------------------------------
        Command syntax:  3C90XCFG CONFIGURE  [ /BSTATE:N  /XCVR:N  /TR:N
                         /FULLDUPLEX:N /OPTIMIZE:N  /LINKBEAT:N ]

        Command line configuration parameters are used to configure the 
        NIC using only the option settings you specify. Some 
        parameters are for all NICs; some are for PCI only. For 
        example, /BSTATE:N is a PCI-only parameter. In most cases, any 
        combination of parameters can be used. Therefore, it is possible
        to modify only a few settings if needed.

        /BSTATE           
            Boot PROM state  
            Possible values - disabled, enabled

        /TR (or /XCVR)
            Transceiver  
            Possible values - Auto, 100BASE-TX, 10BASE-T, COAX, AUI,
                              100BASE-T4, 10BASE-FL, and 100BASE-FX

        /OPTIMIZE 
            Network Driver Optimization
            Possible values - NORMAL, NETWORK, CPU

        /LINKBEAT
            Link Beat disable/enable (pre-10BASE-T standard only)
            Possible values - disabled, enabled
            
            NOTE:  Try this setting ONLY if pre-10BASE-T standard hubs
                   are in use.

        /FULLDUPLEX
            Full Duplex disable/enable 
            Possible values - disabled, enabled

            NOTE:  Enable this setting ONLY if the NIC is
                   connected to a 100BASE-T or 10BASE-T repeater
                   that supports full duplex. Otherwise, it will bring 
                   down the network.


        Command Line with Configuration File
        ------------------------------------
        Command syntax:  3C90XCFG CONFIGURE  /CONFIGFILE:filename

        /CONFIGFILE:filename is used to configure a NIC with the
        settings specified in an ASCII configuration file that can be 
        created and modified by any text editor. The filename can be
        a fully qualified DOS filename including a path. A standard
        format for the file must be used, as follows:
       
        -   Variable names and values match the wording in the
            full-screen Configure window in most cases.

        -   Begin each variable/value line with an "at" symbol (@), 
            followed by a variable name, a colon (:), and the value.

            Example:  @Media type: 100BASE-TX

        -   Blank lines and other white spaces are allowed between 
            variable lines.

        -   Start any comment lines with a semicolon (;).

        -   The variable names allowed are:
            Boot PROM state
            Media type
            Network driver optimization
            Full duplex
            Link beat

        -   The values allowed are the same as those shown in the 
            full-screen Configure window.
        
            Example 1:  @Network driver optimization:Normal
            Example 2:  @Media type:On-board Coax


Diagnostics
-----------

    Full-Screen Windows Mode
    ------------------------
    To run the diagnostic tests using full-screen windowing, type:
    
    3C90XCFG [ENTER] 
    
    Then select the Run Tests option from the Tests menu.

    
    Command Line Option - RUN
    -------------------------

    Command syntax:  3C90XCFG RUN  [/TESTFILE:filename] [/RESULTS:[filename
                     | PRN | PRNHP]] [/ADAPTERNUM:N]

    The RUN parameter executes the diagnostic tests on a selected NIC
    and displays the results on the screen. The defaults are NIC
    number 1 and Group 1 tests. The parameters below are all optional.

    /TESTFILE:filename 
         Specifies a test file that contains a specific test setup
         description.

    /RESULTS:[filename or PRN or PRNHP] 
         Specifies an alternative location to store the test results.
         This location can be a DOS path and filename, PRN printer port
         (same as LPT1), or PRNHP, which is an HP LaserJet printer
         connected to LPT1.

    /ADAPTERNUM:N 
         Specifies the NIC number to be tested, in the case of
         multiple NICs installed in the PC and recognized by 
         this program. Run the LIST command separately (see LIST below)
         to determine the NIC number to use.


Other Command Line Options
--------------------------

HELP
    Command syntax:  3C90XCFG HELP  [Command Keyword]

    HELP is an on-line summary of commands. Without a command keyword
    specified, it gives a summary of the command keywords. With a command 
    keyword specified, it gives the parameter choices for that particular 
    command. For example, 3C90XCFG HELP CONFIGURE gives details about the 
    parameter options for the CONFIGURE command.

LANGUAGE
    Command syntax:  3C90XCFG LANGUAGE  /LANGFILE:filename

    LANGUAGE invokes the program in full Windows mode using a specified
    external resource file. This option provides support for multiple
    languages through a different resource file for each language supported.

    /LANGFILE:filename is a required parameter with this command.
    The filename is the name of the resource file that is loaded by the
    program. The filename can be a fully qualified DOS filename.

    NOTE: At this time, there are no alternative resource files included 
          on the EtherCD or EtherDisk diskette.

LIST
    Command syntax:  3C90XCFG LIST

    LIST displays a list of currently installed NICs (and their 
    assigned NIC numbers) that are recognized by this program. The 
    NIC number is then used as the N value for the /ADAPTERNUM:N 
    parameter when multiple NICs are installed.  There are no 
    parameters associated with the LIST command keyword.

ECHOSERVER
    Command syntax:  3C90XCFG ECHOSERVER  [/ADAPTERNUM:N]

    ECHOSERVER enables a NIC to function within an echo server.
    /ADAPTERNUM:N specifies the NIC to be configured in the 
    echo server, in the case of multiple NICs. 


Further Assistance
------------------
If the NIC fails any of the diagnostic tests, see the TROUBLE.TXT file
in the \HELP directory on the EtherCD (or EtherDisk diskette 2) for 
troubleshooting procedures.

The SUPPORT.TXT file in the \HELP directory on the EtherCD (or EtherDisk 
diskette 2) provides information about obtaining product support for 
the NIC.
