                    Windows 98 Automated Network Installations



This document describes the procedures for performing an automated 
installation of Windows 98 over the network using a 3Com EtherLink PCI
(3C90x) NIC.  The procedures use the 3Com EtherCD version 5.1 or later
software.  (The EtherCD 5.1 software is also available on installation
diskettes.)


Requirements
============
1) Server with enough hard drive space for the Windows 98 source files and 
   any extra drivers that may be required for the installation.

2) DOS client PC that can access the server.  (These instructions assume that 
   you are installing Windows 98 onto a clean DOS system.  With slight 
   modifications, these directions can be applied to several environments).

3) Windows 98 source files.

4) Windows 98 Answer File.  (This file is created with the BATCH 98 utility.  
   The Answer File varies according to your environment.  This document only 
   covers the portion involving the software from this EtherCD or EtherDisk 
   diskettes).

5) This EtherCD or EtherDisk diskettes for the 3Com EtherLink PCI (3C90X)
   NIC family.


Procedures for Unattended Installations of Windows 98
======================================================
The drivers for the 3C90x NICs are not native to Windows 98 and require steps
to integrate them into the installation source files.  This is done with a 
utility called INFINST.EXE, and it is documented in the section "Running the
INFINST.EXE Utility" later in this document.  The INFINST.EXE utility only runs 
on PCs with Windows 98 or Windows NT 4.0 or later.  It does NOT run on PCs with 
Windows 95.

After running the INFINST.EXE utility, you must create a file that automates 
the installation process.  This file is called the Answer File (often named 
MSBATCH.INF).  The complete version of Windows 98 contains the utility (Batch 98) 
needed to create the Answer File.  The Batch 98 utility only runs on PCs with 
Windows 98 or Windows NT 4.0 or later.  It does NOT run on PCs with Windows 95.

After the Answer File is created, you begin the installation process.  The 
installation process is started by executing the SETUP.EXE program for 
Windows 98, which is contained in the source location of the Windows 98 files 
and can be accessed across the network.  (The installation process assumes that 
the installation is being done on a clean DOS system.)

Preparing the Server
-------------------
To prepare the server for automated installations, over the network, of 
Windows 98:

1) Make sure that the server is operational.

2) Copy the Windows 98 source files to a shared directory on the server.

3) Make sure that you have write access to the server.

4) Create a user account on the server, if necessary.

5) For NetWare networks, make sure that you have a Windows 98 or 
   Windows NT 4.0 or later PC that can access the shared location of the 
   Windows 98 source files.  (For Windows NT 4.0 or later, these steps 
   can be done at the file server, the only difference is the drive 
   mappings.)

Running the INFINST.EXE Utility
-------------------------------
The INFINST.EXE utility is used to integrate OEM drivers into the Windows 98 
source files.  This utility must be run for the installation to be successful.  
The INFINST.EXE utility can be found in the TOOLS\RESKIT\INFINST directory 
on the Windows 98 source media.  

To install the software from the EtherCD or EtherDisk, the INFINST.EXE 
utility must be executed against two INF files: W9XEL90X.INF and W9X90XBC.INF.  

The W9XEL90X.INF file applies to the 3C90x family of NICs:
  3C905-TX
  3C905-T4
  3C900-TPO
  3C900-COMBO

The W9X90XBC.INF file applies to the 3C90xC and 3C90xB families of NICs:
  3C905C-TX
  3C905B-TX
  3C905B-FX
  3C905B-COMBO
  3C900B-TPO
  3C900B-TPC
  3C900B-FL
  3C900B-COMBO

1) Start the INFINST.EXE utility.

2) Execute the INF installer against W9X90XBC.INF on the root of EtherCD or 
   EtherDisk 1.

   A warning message appears, stating that the W9XEL90X.INF file has been 
   copied, but may need to be run with the INFINST utility.  Click OK to this
   message.

3) Click OK.

4) After the installation of W9X90XBC.INF is complete, run the INFINST utility 
   against W9XEL90X.INF.   

   A warning message appears, stating that Windows 98 setup already contains 
   an INF file called W9XEl90X.INF.  

5) Click Yes.

   A warning message appears, stating that the MSBATCH.INF must be updated 
   to include any additional clients.  (This is done in the next section, 
   "Creating the Answer File.")

6) Click OK.

Creating the Answer File
------------------------
The Answer File contains all the information needed to automate the 
installation.  This file is created with the Batch 98 utility that comes 
with the Windows 98 source installation media (located in the 
TOOLS\RESKIT\BATCH directory).  

The Batch 98 utility has a SETUP program.  It can only be installed on PCs 
with Windows 98 or Windows NT 4.0 or later.  This document provides 
information on installing the EtherDisk 4.x or later driver set using the 
Batch 98 utility only. For more information on the Batch 98 utility, refer to 
the Windows 98 resource kit.  

An example Answer File is included at the end of this document and can be 
used as a reference.  However, this file varies depending on your requirements.

The Answer File is normally saved as MSBATCH.INF, and it is referred to as such 
in these instructions.   

The following steps describe the portion necessary to automate the 
installation of software from the EtherDisk diskettes version 4.x or later:

1) Install the Batch 98 utility from the Windows 98 source media.  
   (The Batch 98 SETUP program can be found in the TOOLS\RESKIT\BATCH 
   directory.)

2) Run the Batch 98 utility.  

3) Make the appropriate selections for protocols, clients, services, and so on.
   To install the software from the EtherDisk diskettes, an additional setting 
   must be made under the Additional Clients tab in the Network Options portion 
   of the Batch 98 utility.  Enter TCAATDI in the Other Clients field.  If multiple 
   items are specified in Other Clients, they are separated by a comma.

4) After making the necessary settings, save the file.  (By default, the file 
   is saved as MSBATCH.INF.)

5) After saving the settings, make the following changes to the [network] 
   section of the Answer File (MSBATCH.INF):

   [network]
   .
   .
   .
   IgnoreDetectedNetCards=1
   NetCards="PCI\VEN_10b7&DEV_9055"   ; 3C905B-TX

   The above example is for the 3C905B-TX NIC. For other 3C90x NICs, enter 
   the correct PCI device ID, as described below:

       NetCards="PCI\VEN_10b7&DEV_9050"   ; 3C905-TX
       NetCards="PCI\VEN_10b7&DEV_9058"   ; 3C905B-Combo
       NetCards="PCI\VEN_10b7&DEV_905A"   ; 3C905B-FX
       NetCards="PCI\VEN_10b7&DEV_9051"   ; 3C905-T4
       NetCards="PCI\VEN_10b7&DEV_9004"   ; 3C900B-TPO
       NetCards="PCI\VEN_10b7&DEV_9005"   ; 3C900B-Combo
       NetCards="PCI\VEN_10b7&DEV_9006"   ; 3C900B-TPC
       NetCards="PCI\VEN_10b7&DEV_900A"   ; 3C900B-FL
       NetCards="PCI\VEN_10b7&DEV_9000"   ; 3C900-TPO
       NetCards="PCI\VEN_10b7&DEV_9001"   ; 3C900-Combo

Initiating the Installation
---------------------------
To start the installation, a network connection is required to the shared 
directory of the Windows 98 source files on the server.

When initiating the SETUP, you must specify the location of the Answer File.  
For example:

    J:>setup j:\msbatch.inf
