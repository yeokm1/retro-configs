1.0 Installation Issues


  1.1 Novell Client for DOS and Windows 3.1x is an IPX-only   
     Application

     The Novell Client for DOS and Windows 3.1x is an IPX-only
     application.  If you want to connect to NetWare 5 IP-only
     servers using the Novell Client for DOS and Windows 3.1x,
     you must install Compatibility Mode on the IP-only servers
     and have a Migration Agent on the network.

     If you have only NetWare 3 or 4 servers, you do not have to
     install additional software on the servers. 

     Note: An across-the-wire installation can be done with the
     DOS IP client. See the dos_ip.txt file located in the
     products/doswin32/nls/<language> directory for details.

  1.2 New Files Created during Installation 

     The DOS Install creates new startnet.bat and net.cfg files.
     The old files are left on the workstation but the
     extensions are changed to .old.

     The Windows Install creates new startnet.bat and net.cfg
     files.  The old files are left on the workstation but the
     extensions are changed to an incremental number (.00?)
     based on how many times you have installed.


  1.3 LAN Drivers That Request a SLOT Value

     If you are using the following 32-bit LAN drivers, you
     might be prompted to enter the SLOT value for the LAN
     adapter after restarting the workstation.  This occurs
     because you are loading an additional frame type.

     LAN drivers that require a SLOT value: 
 
       3C5X9 
       3C589
       3C59X
       3C90X
       E100B

     To resolve this, add the SLOT number on the driver load
     line of the startnet.bat file.  For example: 

       LOAD 3C90X.LAN FRAME=ETHERNET_II SLOT=2

     Note: Unfortunately, no official standard for determining
     the slot value exists.  Most manufactures label the slots
     on the back of the hardware or document the slot value in
     the product documentation they provide.


  1.4 "The LAN adapter could not be installed for this location. 
      The adapter type has been set to none.  You will need to
      edit the properties for this location and reinstall the
      adapter or choose a different one before using this
      location online"  

     This message appears when the long driver name has changed
     since the last time you installed. To resolve this, select
     Install a New Adapter, and then choose the correct adapter
     during installation.  This reinitializes the long driver
     name with the correct string.


  1.5 Workstation Freezes during DOS Install or Message "Error
      reading LDI file" Occurs

     During a DOS install (install.exe), the workstation freezes
     or a message appears indicating that there is an error
     reading the LDI file.  This error occurs because the
     workstation does not have enough conventional memory to
     handle LDI files over 40 KB.  To solve this problem:

     1. In the products\doswin32\landrv32 directory, locate the
        file for your LAN driver. 
     
       LDI file names correspond to the LAN driver name.

     2. Open the file in a text editor.

     3. Delete the unnecessary languages located at end of file
        to reduce the file size.
     
     4. Save the modified LDI file to same directory.
       
       Note: If you are installing from CD-ROM, save this file
       to a diskette.

     5. Run install.exe again.
       
       Note: If you are installing from CD-ROM, choose
       User-Specified Driver(16-bit or 32-bit), and then choose
       this file from the diskette during installation.


  1.6 Installing Windows 3.1x Dial-In Services

     If you select the dial-in services option during the
     Windows 3.1x installation (setup.exe), make sure that you
     create a location profile during the initial installation. 
     Dial-in services uses the location profile and requires
     that one exist even if you will not be using multiple
     location profiles for various configurations.     

     If you select the dial-in services option and do not create
     a location profile, you will not have access to the network
     and will need to reinstall the client and create a location
     profile. 


  1.7 Installing Multiple Clients from a Login Script

     If you plan to install the Novell Client software on
     multiple workstations, you can install from the network by
     copying files to the server and modifying the login script.
     Even if your network has workstations on multiple
     platforms, you can install and upgrade the client software
     on all platforms when users log in. 

     Complete instructions including a sample login script are
     included in the inst_log.txt file located at the root of
     the CD-ROM.

2.0  General Issues



  2.1 Path Length Limited to 64 Characters with DOS Name Space

     Directories on volumes that have only the DOS name space
     cannot have a combined path length greater than 64
     characters.  If the directory path has more than 64
     characters, Get Current Directory fails and regresses the
     path until it finds a directory with a path length of 64
     characters or less.  This is not an issue for volumes that
     have the long name space.


  2.2 NDSManager v1.06 Hangs Workstation When Using the Create
      Alias Feature  

     NDSManager v1.06 might hang the client workstation if
     Create Alias is used to move a partition.  To resolve this,
     upgrade to the latest version of NDSManager (v1.24)
     included in Support Pack 3.0. 


  2.3 Windows for Workgroups Workstations Running the Client
      and Norton Utilities 8.0 encounter a Device Driver
      Conflict with Nioswin.nlm


      If you are using  Windows for Workgroups using Norton
      Utilities 8.0, you might encounter a device driver
      conflict with nioswin.nlm.

      To resolve this, upgrade the Norton symevnt.386 device
      driver.  The file can be obtained at the following
      Symantec FTP site:  ftp://ftp.symantec.com/public/english_us_canada/symevnt/. 
      


  2.4  Map.exe Might Fail When Mapping a Drive to an NDS Object


      Map.exe is not IP-aware for NDS objects. As a result,
      map.exe might fail if you try to use it to map a drive to
      an NDS object with a command like the following:
  
           map n .mydir.organization.company

      The failure will result in a message such as:

           MAP-4.13-195: Directory
          [N.mydir.organization.company] cannot be located

      This error can be avoided by using one of the following
      solutions:

      * Use "map n server\vol:\directory" instead of "map n
      .mydir.organization.company".

      * Unbind IP from the server that the NDS object points to.

      * Configure the Protocol Preferences of Novell Client
      property page to use IPX only.


  2.5 Login Windows Fails to Open in Windows


      If you have installed and are using Z.E.N.works to manage
      your workstations (Workstation Manager), the Windows GUI
      login window might fail to open.  This is because
      Workstation Manager has already authenticated to the
      network to download the workstation preferences.  However,
      the user is not logged in to the network.

      To make sure that the login window appears every time the
      workstation is started, complete the following steps:


      1.  Double-click the Novell Client program group.
 
      2.  Double-click NetWare User Tools.

      3.  Double-click NetWare Settings (or Alt-S).

      4.  Click the Startup tab.

      5.  Check the Login If Authenticated check box.
      
      6.  Click OK.
      
      
  2.6 DOS Utilities Supported Only When Used with IPX or IP
  Compatibility Mode

      The DOS Utilities (CX, MAP, CAPTURE, etc.) are supported
      only when used with IPX or IP Compatibility Mode.  Use the
      equivalent GUI-based utilities when accessing resources
      that are only available from IP servers.


=================================================================


3.0  Primary Documentation Is HTML

  The HTML files for the Novell Client for DOS and Windows
  3.1x--containing information on installing, configuring, using,
  understanding, and troubleshooting--are the primary
  documentation.  The HTML documentation is available on the
  Novell Client CD-ROM in the Novdocs directory.  The search and
  print functionality are available on 32-bit operating systems
  such as Windows 95 and Windows NT.

  In addition to the HTML documentation, interface and enduser
  documentation can be found in the Client help.  To access the
  help, click Novell Client Help in the Novell Client program
  group.  All the Client help information is accessible from this
  file.  The Client help file (setup.hlp) can also be accessed
  prior to installation in the client/doswin32/nls/<language>
  directory.
