1.0 Introduction

  Novell Clients for various platforms are available on the
  Client CD-ROM or from the Novell Corporate web site. However,
  you might need to install the Novell Client on a workstation
  that does not have a CD-ROM drive or does not have access to
  the Internet.  You might also need to install a DOS IP-only
  client in order to complete across-the-wire installations of
  NetWare 5 servers. This document includes instructions for
  both types of DOS IP-only installations.

  Note: Other issues with the Novell Client for DOS and Windows
  3.1x are contained in the doswin.txt file located at the root
  and in the products/doswin32/nls/<language> directory.



2.0 Creating a Bootable Diskette for a DOS Install (IP
only)

  To install the Novell Client on a workstation that does not
  have a CD-ROM drive or does not have access to the Internet,
  you must create a bootable diskette for a DOS install.  Once
  the client is installed,  the workstation will have access to
  the network.  

  To create a bootable diskette, complete the following steps.

     1. Make sure you have access to the Novell Client DOS files
        located in the Products/Doswin32 directory.
     
     2. Format a 1.44MB high density diskette with the system
        files by entering the following at the DOS prompt:
  
        FORMAT A: /S
  
     3. Copy himem.sys to the diskette.

     4. In a text editor, create a config.sys file on the
        diskette that includes the following command to load
        himem.sys 
  
        DEVICE=A:\HIMEM.SYS

     5. Create a Client32 directory on the diskette.

     6. Use the nlmpackr.exe utility on the Client CD-ROM in the
        Products/Doswin32 directory to add the following nlm
        files from the following directories to the Client32
        directory.
     
        FILE                  DIRECTORY           
        trannta.nlm      Products/Doswin32/Client32
        client32.nlm     Products/Doswin32/Client32
        srvloc.nlm       Products/Doswin32/Client32
        ethertsm.nlm     Products/Doswin32/Nios
        lslc32.nlm       Products/Doswin32/Nios
        cmsm.nlm         Products/Doswin32/Nios
        nbic32.nlm       Products/Doswin32/Nios
        tcpip.nlm        Products/Doswin32/Tcpip

       using the following syntax for each NLM at the DOS
       prompt:

          NLMPACKR TRANTA.NLM A:\Client32\TRANTA.NLM

     7. Copy the following files from the following directories
        to the Client32 directory on the diskette:
     
        FILE                  DIRECTORY
        nios.exe         Products/Doswin32/Nios
        ping.msg         Products/Doswin32/Tcpip
        ping.exe         Products/Doswin32/Tcpip
        *.lan files      Products/Doswin32/Landrv32

          NOTE: You will only be able to copy four or five LAN
          drivers due to space restrictions. Choose the drivers
          you frequently use) 


     8. In a text editor, create a net.cfg file on the diskette
        and make sure the BIND command reflects the LAN driver,
        preferred server, and name context you are using.  See
        Section 3.3 for a sample net.cfg file.

     9. In a text editor, create an autoexec.bat file on the
        diskette with the following settings:

        LOAD A:\CLIENT32\NIOS.EXE
        LOAD A:\CLIENT32\NBIC32.NLM
        LOAD A:\CLIENT32\LSLC32.NLM
        LOAD A:\CLIENT32\CMSM.NLM
        LOAD A:\CLIENT32\ETHERTSM.NLM
        LOAD A:\CLIENT32\3c90x.LAN FRAME=Ethernet_II
        LOAD A:\CLIENT32\TCPIP.NLM
        LOAD A:\CLIENT32\TRANNTA.NLM
        LOAD A:\CLIENT32\SRVLOC.NLM
        LOAD A:\CLIENT32\CLIENT32.NLM

  You can boot from this diskette and login to the network in an
  IP-only environment to complete an across-the-wire server
  installation.



3.0  Enabling IP Protocols in the DOS Client for
     Across-the-Wire Server Installations 

3.1 Enabling IP Protocols

  You can install NetWare 5 servers across-the-wire in an
  IP-only environment (No IPX traffic). The instructions outline
  the changes needed to enable the DOS client to use IP
  protocols. To do this, complete the following steps.

  1. Run install.exe from the Products\Doswin32\ directory of
     the Client CD.
  
  2. Choose to install the TCP/IP Protocol Stack and then
     complete the installation.
  
     Note: Server installs do not currently support DHCP
     addresses.  Choose User Specified and manually specify the
     IP address, Router gateway, and subnetmask that the server
     will use.

  3. Configure the startnet.bat by doing the following:
      a.  Remove "LOAD IPX.NLM" line
      b.  Remove "LOAD SPX_SKTS.NLM"
      c.  Remove all frame types except the Ethernet_II
      d.  Add "LOAD SRVLOC.NLM" following the load of TCPIP.NLM

  4. Configure net.cfg by doing the following:
      a.  Add File Cache Level = 0 to the NetWare Dos Requester
          section. This setting prevents the client from
          allocating any memory to file cache.
      b.  Add Preferred Server = <servername> or Preferred
          Server = <IP address>  to the NetWare Dos Requester
          section.
      c.  Remove any lines that reference IPX or frame types
          except Ethernet_II.  

        Note: You may be modifying the net.cfg that was
        generated by the DOS client install and this file
        contains IPX references.          


  5. In the autoexec.bat, remove the line 
     @CALL C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\STARTNET.  
  
      This allows you to boot the computer without running
      STARTNET once the server install is finished.
 
  6. Copy the trannta.nlm from the products\win95\ibm_enu 
     directory on the client CD to C:\novell\client32. This 
     will replace the existing IPX trannta.nlm.
        
		 

3.2 Sample Startnet.bat

     C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\NIOS.EXE
     LOAD C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\NBIC32.NLM
     LOAD C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\LSLC32.NLM
     LOAD C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\CMSM.NLM
     LOAD C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\ETHERTSM.NLM
     LOAD C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\CNE2000.LAN  INT=3 PORT=300
       RETRIES=5 FRAME=Ethernet_II
     LOAD C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\TCPIP.NLM
     LOAD C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\TRANNTA.NLM
     LOAD C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\SRVLOC.NLM
     LOAD C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\CLIENT32.NLM


3.3 Sample Net.cfg

     Protocol TCPIP
       IP_ADDRESS 137.65.51.113
       IP_ROUTER 137.65.51.254
       IP_NETMASK 255.255.252.0
       PATH TCP_CFG C:\NOVELL\CLIENT32\TCP
       BIND CNE2000
  
     NETWARE DOS REQUESTER
       FILE CACHE LEVEL = 0
       FIRST NETWORK DRIVE = F
       PREFERRED SERVER = <Servername or IP address>
       NAME CONTEXT = "OU=CLIENT.O=NOVELL"

4.0  Primary Documentation Is HTML

  The HTML files for the Novell Client for DOS and Windows
  3.1x--containing information on installing, configuring,
  using, understanding, and troubleshooting--are the primary
  documentation.  The HTML documentation is available on the
  Novell Client CD-ROM in the Novdocs directory.  The search and
  print functionality are available on 32-bit operating systems
  such as Windows 95 and Windows NT.

  In addition to the HTML documentation, interface and enduser
  documentation can be found in the Client help.  To access the
  help, click Novell Client Help in the Novell Client program
  group.  All the Client help information is accessible from
  this file.  The Client help file (setup.hlp) can also be
  accessed prior to installation in the
  Client/Doswin32/Nls/<language> directory.
