Installing Server Support for AutoLink


 3Com's auto installation software, AutoLink, copies the NetWare DOS
 Requester software from the EtherDisk diskette to the system you are 
 configuring for NetWare.  You may have newer versions of this software from 
 another source.  If so, the Autolink program can download the NetWare
 client software from the server instead of the EtherDisk diskette.  This
 feature can be used to install newer versions of the software or to 
 customize your installation.
 
 Autolink can also install basic Netware support for Windows 3.1X and 
 Windows For Workgroups 3.11.  These two options can be specified by using
 install.exe in the root directory of EtherDisk.
 
 AutoLink installs the NetWare client software from the EtherDisk diskette,
 then starts it, and connects to a server.  Once connected, AutoLink looks
 in the LOGIN directory of the server for a file called 3INSTALL.BAT.  If
 this file exists, AutoLink will spawn it.
 
 If you want to deliver installations specific to your environment, your
 system administrator can create a batch file named 3INSTALL.BAT to copy
 specific software required during your client installation process.  For
 example, you may have multiple protocols, unique configurations, special
 application software, or non-NetWare clients in your network environment.
