Troubleshooting

If the EtherLink III LAN PC Card diagnostic tests fail, 
the PC Card may not be defective.

Check the following:

1. Make sure that the  PC Card is operating in a computer 
   containing the PC Card standard Type II or Type III slots.

2. Make sure that the PC Card is completely seated in its 
   slot. Review the installation instructions in the 
   EtherLink III LAN PC Card user guide.

3. Make sure that your computer is running DOS 3.1 or 
   higher and that no device drivers or memory managers are 
   loaded.

4. Inspect all cables and connections.

5. If you are running the Echo Exchange test, make sure 
   that the EtherLink III LAN PC Card is securely connected 
   to a properly cabled network and an echo server is set up 
   on the network.

6. If you are configuring the I/O base address or interrupt 
   request level make sure that the settings you select for 
   these parameters do not conflict with any other peripheral 
   or software program installed in the computer. If your 
   computer has Card Services, these parameters are set 
   automatically, and you cannot change them.

7. The computer in which the EtherLink III LAN PC Card 
   is installed may be defective.  Install the PC Card in a 
   known functioning computer and run the tests again.

8. Replace the failed EtherLink III LAN PC Card with a 
   known working PC Card, with the same configuration. If 
   the second PC Card fails, something is probably wrong 
   with the test environment, not with the PC Card.
