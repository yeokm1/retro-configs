DEC PATHWORKS for DOS/Windows v4.1
=====================================


To install DEC PATHWORKS version 4.1 on a DOS NDIS 
workstation, DOS must be installed on the target workstation C:
drive, or you must have a bootable DOS floppy.  Follow these 
steps:

1. Insert the PATHWORKS DOS Client Setup diskette version 4.1 
   in your floppy drive.

2. Change to that drive and execute the NETSETUP.EXE program.

3. Follow the screens to select a Transport Protocol.

4. Insert the appropriate diskettes for the selection 
   you made in step 3.

5. Select your network adapter by typing ETHERNET.
 
6. Select the option (OTHER NDIS) adapters.

7. When prompted for the DRIVE:\PATH\FILENAME for the NDIS 
   driver, type:

		A:\MSLANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\ETHERNET\ELPC3\ELPC3.DOS

8. When prompted for the full DRIVE:\PATH of the PROTOCOL.INI
   fragment, type:

		A:\ MSLANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\ETHERNET\ELPC3\PROTOCOL.INI

9. Follow the rest of the installation screens and the 
   procedure for writing the KEY DISK.

   The NETSETUP program will build the PROTOCOL.INI file for 
   you and modify your startup files to use the adapter you
   have selected.



 NOTE:  You must add the /N parameter to the line in the 
        STARTNET.BAT file. That starts the network scheduler.

        For example:

           %BOOT%\DECNET\sch /h /n
