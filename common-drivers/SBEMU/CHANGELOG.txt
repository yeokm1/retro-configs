CD-Audio mixer support, by thp (Thomas Perl).
Runtime debugging over serial port, by thp (Thomas Perl).
Text-mode UI: Nice display of sound card name, and highlight important messsge with color, by thp (Thomas Perl).
move "fix time constant for exact 11/22/44 kHz" to the option, by wbcbz7
improve SB direct mode audio quality, by wbcbz7
Drivers: Add PIO support to Intel HDA, by jiyunomegami.
Drivers: Ensoniq ES1371 supported.
MPU-401 UART emulation with serial MIDI output, by jiyunomegami.
Drivers: C-Media CMI 8338/8738 supported, by crazii & jiyunomegami.
Expermimental: IRQ assignment if PCI sound card IRQ is invalid or above 15.
Drivers: YAMAHA YMF supported, by jiyunomegami.
PCM resampling improvements and fix low-frequency interpolation (Skyroads SFX).
HDPMI: PCI IRQ client bypass, send to SBEMU/BIOS directly and hide from games - fix freeze for DOOM. Thanks to veelstekel for testing.
Build: enable -O2 and -flto optimizations.
Command line: /I9 supported for IRQ9 if IRQ5/7 not working due to IRQ conflicts, by jiyunomegami.
Command line: options support decimals, i.e. /K22050 and other arbitrary values, by jiyunomegami.
Add /SCFM and /SCMPU for cards that have builtin FM and MPU (not enabled by default, need specify in command line), by jiyunomegami.
Drivers: /SCFM /SCMPU for CMI cards, by jiyunomegami.
Drivers: MMIO fix for ICH4 boards, by jiyunomegami.
Drivers: new set of Linux sound card drivers ported, by jiyunomegami. New dirvers:
    ALS4000
    EMU10K1X (Dell SB0200)
    X-Fi (both EMU20K1 and EMU20K2)
    OXYGEN(CMI8788) (Only tested with Asus Xonar DG)
    ESS Allegro-1 (ES1988S/ES1989S)
    Trident 4D Wave
IRQ guard to prevent the virtual SB IRQ sending to BIOS.
Bugfix: crash on calling HDPMI functions, and crash on error exiting.
Bugfix: DMA address mapping using DPMI_MapMemory/DPMI_UnmapMemory that doesn't work properly and cause leaks.
Bugfix: SB16: IRQ/DMA mixer registers not initialized properly, seen in TOMBRAIDER's SETUP.
Add high DMA check, force /Hx=/Dx when /Hx uses low DMA for 16 bit PCM.
Bugfix: prevent compiler optimization on MMIO reads/writes.
Bugfix: fix for some Intel HDA chips that mutes the sound for unkown reason.
Add README.txt & CHANGLOG.txt, shipped with binaries in zip file.
Compatibility: make /H option working if /T6 not set.
Some trivial bugfixes and improvements.

1.0 Beta3
Merge commit from HDPMI: add -x[n] option to limit memory further, -x1 limit mem to 128MB, -x2 limit mem to 64MB. this may help some games that do work with large memory. - by @Baron von Riedesel.
Remove debug message for HDPMI.
Fix Epic Pinball sound spedup.
Add delay to DSP command 0Fh (IRQ request) to make Dynablaster work, and potentially other games.
Add DSP commands: 0E4h/0E8h (test read/write), 0E2h (DMA id), 045h (continue auto DMA).
Fix /Tn bug, /t2 as SBPro, instead of SB2.0. by @jtchip
Bugfix on VIA VT8233/8235/8237


1.0 Beta2c:
Add "/R" option to reset sound card driver, in case the soundcard is touched by other utilities.
Add SB direct mode handling (non-DMA, DSP command 10h) previously requested by @Bondi. tested game: Shanghai 2 - experimental, may have noises.
Bugfix on BLASTER env set. (seen on FreeDOS or MSDOS prior to 7.0)
Set power states for Intel HDA, fix compatibility issues for some PCs.
Bugfix on volume settings, disable mixer resetting on DSP resetting, make volume consistent among games and can be set properly by SB utilities.
Hack: double the "volume" of OPL so that it sounds near to the digital volume.
Other bugfixes that may fix functionality or improve stability.

1.0 Beta2b:
Fix SB Live/Audigy interrupt.
Add option "/SCL" to list sound cards, use "/SC[n]" to select sound card.
Experimental: adjust sound buffer to reduce latency. (1/8 to original).
