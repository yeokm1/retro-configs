# Commands with permissions: dele, mkd, rmd, rnfr, stor, appe, stou

# DOS paths are in /drive_X/path form where X is the drive letter.
# For example, e:/ftpdata is written as /drive_e/ftpdata .
#
# For sandboxdir, enter [none] or a full path name (drive letter included)
# For uploaddir, enter [any] or a full path name (relative if using sandbox,
#   or absolute if not using the sandbox).
