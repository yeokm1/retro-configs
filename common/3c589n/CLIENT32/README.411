Network Drivers Installation Notes


NOVELL NETWARE 32-bit Drivers
This document describes how to configure the 3C589D PC Card for 
use with the Novell NetWare 32-bit drivers. These procedures are
also described in the EtherLink III LAN PC Card User Guide.
You can install the NetWare 32-bit driver for clients and servers. 
The 32-bit network driver only works in a PC with Client 32 software 
installed on it. The drivers are in the \CLIENT32 directory on the 
EtherDisk diskette.


NOTE: The following instructions assume that you have not
      installed any other network adapter in the machine. If you
      have been using a network connection on your PC,
      some of the following instructions may not apply or may
      produce different results. Contact  your MIS department
      or network manager for further instructions.

Before installing the network driver, you should know:

      - Your Novell file server name
      - Your network account user name and password (supplied
        by your MIS department or network manager)

Also, for a successful installation, you will need:

- 3C589D LAN PC Card and the accompanying EtherDisk
        diskette
        

Windows 95 without Client 32 Installed
To install the driver in a PC without Client 32 installed, 
perform the following steps:

  1. Install the 3C589D PC Card and connect it 
     to the network, as described in Chapter 2.

  2. Copy the ODI3C589.INF file from the \client 
     directory on the EtherDisk diskette to disk 1(setup) 
     of the Client 32 for Windows 95 software.

  3. Copy the 3C589.LAN driver to the LAN 
     driver diskette (32 bit). 

  4. Install Client 32 according to 
     Novell's Client 32 documentation. 
     The driver installation is complete.


Windows 95 without Client 32 Installed using
the Hard Drive or the Network

To install the driver on a PC, using the network or 
hard drive without Client 32 installed, perform the 
following steps:

  1. Install the 3C589D PC Card and connect it to the 
     network, as described in Chapter 2.

  2. Copy the ODI3C589.INF file and the 3C589.LAN 
     driver to the \PUBLIC\CLIENT\WIN95\IBM_ENU directory. 

  3. Install Client 32 according to Novell's Client 32
     documentation.  The driver installation is complete.

Windows 95 with Client 32 Installed
To install the driver on a PC, using the network or 
hard drive without Client 32 installed, perform 
the following steps:

  1. Remove adapters from the Network control panel 
     for any cards that are no longer in the PC or are 
     going to be removed including ODINSUP and 
     any associated files. 

  2. Copy the ODI3C589.INF file for the new 
     PC Card into the C:\WINDOWS\INF directory. 

  3. Switch to the Windows\INF directory.

  4. Rename NET3COM.INF to NET3COM.OLD.

  5. Reboot your PC.

  6. Install the 3C589D PC Card and connect it to the 
     network as described in Chapter 2 and reboot your PC.

     Windows 95 automatically detects the PC Card. 
     The Client 32 driver is loaded. 
     You are prompted for Client 32 diskettes. 

  7. Complete the Client 32 installation and reboot the PC. 
     The driver installation is complete.


DOS Client 32 
To install the driver on a PC running DOS or 
Windows 3.x, without Client 32 installed, 
perform the following steps:

  1. Copy the 3C589mgr.exe from the EtherDisk to C:\.

  2. Edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file to 
     add the following line to the beginning of the file.
     C:\3C589MGR.EXE

  3. Run 3c589MGR.exe and write down the IRQ and 
     PORT settings. 

  4. Start the Client 32 installation using
     the Client 32 NetWare documentation.  

  5. When prompted for Disk 5 -LAN DRIVER or 
     Third Party Diskette,insert the Etherdisk and give
     the path A:\CLIENT32

     When the Client32 installation is complete reboot the PC. 

  6. On some laptops a special switch is needed when loading
     the LAN driver in the STARTNET.BAT file.  If the LAN driver
     does not successfully load, Edit the STARTNET.BAT file and
     verify that the 3c589.Lan line looks similar to:
     load c:\novell\client32\3c589.lan enabler port=X irq=Y Frame=ZZZ
     Where X=the IRQ and Y=the Port as specified by 3c589mgr.exe.

     The driver installation is complete.

NetWare 4.11 32-bit Server Without Card Services
To install the driver on a NetWare 4.11, perform the following steps:

  1. Install the 3C589D PC Card and connect it to the 
     network as described in Chapter 2.

  2. Insert the EtherDisk diskette in the diskette drive.

  3. Copy 3C589MGR.EXE and 3C589.LAN 
     from the EtherDisk diskette to c:\nwserver. 

  4. Add the 3c589mgr.exe 
     to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and save.
     3C589MGR.EXE /IRQ=Y
     (where Y is a free interrupt on the laptop.  This line must be
      executed before running the SERVER.EXE command. Note the interrupt
      and port address that is echoed.)
     

     After the SERVER.EXE is executed and Netware 4.11 has started
     the following line 

     
     load c:\novell\client32\3c589.lan enabler port=X irq=Y Frame=ZZZ
     (Where X=the IRQ and Y=the Port as specified by 3c589mgr.exe.  ZZZ
      is the desired frame type, i.e Ethernet_802.2)
     bind 3c589 IPX NET=XXX
     The driver installation is complete.

*Note: Although the 3C589.LAN driver is a fully supported driver by 
Novell, some laptop keyboard implementations may not allow you to 
break into the Novell debugger.
