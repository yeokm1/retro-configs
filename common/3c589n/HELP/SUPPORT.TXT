Returning Products for Repair

A product sent directly to 3Com for repair must first be 
assigned a Return Materials Authorization number (RMA).  
A product sent to 3Com without an RMA number will be 
returned to the sender unopened, at the sender's expense.
When you call for an RMA number, be prepared to provide 
the product name,serial number, and diagnostic error 
messages.  Payment, shipping instructions, and turnaround 
time will be confirmed when the RMA number is assigned.

To obtain an RMA number, call or fax:
