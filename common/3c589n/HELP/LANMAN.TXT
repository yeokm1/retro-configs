Microsoft LAN Manager

Microsoft LAN Manager versions 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2
------------------------------------------------

 You must create an OEM import diskette for the
 LAN Manager installer.

 1. Format a diskette.
 2. Create the MSLANMAN.DOS directory structure
    on the diskette.

    Directory \MSLANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\ETHERNET\ELPC3
    Directory \MSLANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\NIF

 3. Copy the two files; ELPC3.DOS and PROTOCOL.INI
    from the \NDIS2 subdirectory on the EtherDisk
    to the ELPC3 subdirectory on the OEM import
    diskette.

    Copy the file, ELPC3.NIF from the \NDIS2
    subdirectory on the EtherDisk to the NIF
    subdirectory on the OEM import diskette.


 That completes the OEM import diskette.  Use the 
 import function of the LAN Manager installer to
 capture the NDIS driver from the OEM import diskette.  
 Be sure to save the new configuration before exiting 
 the installer.



DOS installation with Lan Manager 2.2
-------------------------------------

 The following describes the procedure for 
 importing the driver during installation of 
 Lan Manager 2.2 for DOS.

 1. Begin the MS-DOS Lan Manager installation by 
    inserting the MS LAN Manager 2.2 Setup Disk and 
    typing A:SETUP.

 2. After reading the Microsoft Drivers 1 diskette, 
    a window is displayed showing available Network 
    Adapter Drivers.  In this window choose the
    following function:

    Select Other Driver         (Alt-D)

 3. When prompted to insert your network driver 
    diskette, insert the OEM import diskette.

 4. After the driver is imported from the diskette, 
    a box will be displayed showing the driver.  
    Select the 3Com LAN PC Card.

 5. Continue with the remainder of the installation 
    by next selecting a protocol to use with the 
    3Com LAN PC Card driver.
