NDIS 2.01 Drivers Installation Notes


 Banyan VINES
 ------------

 To install VINES 6.0 software on a DOS NDIS 
 workstation, follow these instructions.  DOS 
 must be installed on the target workstation 
 C: drive, or you must have a bootable DOS floppy.

 1.  Use the DOS MD command to create a subdirectory 
     called \VINES.

 2.  Copy the contents of the VINES LAN S/W (DOS) 
     Install diskette into the \VINES subdirectory.

 3.  Copy the contents of the NDIS subdirectory on 
     the VINES LAN S/W (DOS) 2 of 2 diskette into 
     the \VINES subdirectory.

 4.  Copy the ELPC3.DOS from NDIS2\DOS on the 
     EtherDisk diskette to the C:\VINES subdirectory.

 5.  Copy the PROTOCOL.INI fragment from the 
     \MSLANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\ETHERNET\ELPC3 subdirectory
     on the EtherDisk diskette to the \VINES subdirectory.

 6.  Edit the PROTOCOL.INI file to read as follows:

     [PROTOCOL MANAGER]
      DRIVERNAME = PROTMAN$

     [VINES_XIF]
      DRIVERNAME = NDISBAN$
      BINDINGS = ELINKPC3

     [ELINKPC3]
      DRIVERNAME = ELPC3$
         
 7.  Run the PCCONFIG.EXE program located in the 
     \VINES subdirectory.

 8.  Select option 1, Network Card Settings.

 9.  Select the NDIS Ethernet option.

 10. The NDIS workstation screen appears.  Enter 
     the IRQ that you selected for the 3C589 PC Card. 
     Select the IRQ using the Configuration
     and Diagnostic Program. 

 11. Press F10 twice to return to the first menu.

 12. On the next screen, select option 2, Login 
     Environment Settings.

 13. On the next screen, select option 1, Default 
     Communications Driver.

 14. In the next screen scroll down to NDIS Ethernet 
     and press enter.

 15. Exit PCCONFIG by pressing [F10] to save the new 
     configuration.

 16. Edit the CONFIG.SYS file and add the following 
     lines, substituting A: for C: for a floppy 
     disk installation.
                                   
     DEVICE = C:\VINES\PROTMAN.DOS /I:C:\VINES
     DEVICE = C:\VINES\ELPC3.DOS
     LASTDRIVE = M

 17. Edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and add the following
     lines:

     CD\VINES
     BAN
     CD\

     BAN loads the NDISBAN drivers and reads the 
     PCCONFIG.DB file to invoke changes made during the
     PCCONFIG stage.

If you are not using Card Services and you are using a 
memory manager, you must exclude the CIS memory 
range for the 3C589 PC Card and other Card Service devices. 
For more information, see Appendix A of the user guide.
