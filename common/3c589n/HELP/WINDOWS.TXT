Windows Installation Information
    

Windows 3.x or Windows for Workgroups (WFW)
-------------------------------------------
If NetWare is the network operating system, then the 3Com AutoLink program
can be used for the driver installation.

For non-NetWare environments, install the client software as specified by 
your network operating system vendor. Windows 3.x and WFW have internal 
support for Microsoft networking environments.


Windows 95 and Windows NT

Proceed directly to Windows 95.  Do not configure the adapter from the 
3Com EtherDisk diskette.  Windows 95 Plug and Play will complete the
installation for Novell, Microsoft, and most other network operating 
systems.


Windows NT
----------
Use the configuration software provided on this EtherDisk diskette to 
automatically set adapter parameters suitable for this PC. Then proceed 
to Windows NT to install client software for Novell, Microsoft, and most
other network operating systems.
