INT 33 - MS MOUSE - RESET DRIVER AND READ STATUS
	AX = 0000h

	    FFFFh hardware/driver installed
	BX = number of buttons

	    0003h Mouse Systems/Logitech three-button mouse
	    FFFFh two buttons
Notes:	since INT 33 might be uninitialized on old machines, the caller
	  should first check that INT 33 is neither 0000h:0000h nor points at
	  an IRET instruction (BYTE CFh) before calling this API
	to use mouse on a Hercules-compatible monographics card in graphics
	  mode, you must first set 0040h:0049h to 6 for page 0 or 5 for page 1,
	  and then call this function.	Logitech drivers v5.01 and v6.00
	  reportedly do not correctly use Hercules graphics in dual-monitor
	  systems, while version 4.10 does.
	the Logitech mouse driver contains the signature string "LOGITECH"
	  three bytes past the interrupt handler; many of the Logitech mouse
	  utilities check for this signature.
	Logitech MouseWare v6.30 reportedly does not support CGA video modes
	  if no CGA is present when it is started and the video board is
	  later switched into CGA emulation

INT 33 - MS MOUSE - GET VERSION STRING
	AX = 006Dh 'm'
Return: ES:DI -> Microsoft version number of resident driver (see #03187)
Notes:	also supported by Logitech, Mouse Systems, Kraft, and Genius mouse
	  drivers
	the Mouse Systems 7.01 and Genius Mouse 9.06 drivers report their
	  Microsoft version as 7.00 even though they do not support any of the
	  functions from 0025h through 002Dh supported by the MS 7.00 driver
	  (the Genius Mouse driver supports function 0026h, but it differs
	  from the Microsoft function)
	the TRUEDOX 4.01 driver reports its version as 6.26 through this call,
	  but as 6.24 through AX=0024h
	There seems to be no reliable method to distinguish MS MOUSE before
	  3.00 from mouse drivers of other vendors.
	Some releases of the MS MOUSE 6.00 erroneously return 6.01 instead of
	  their true version number.  In this case, a DI value of 01ABh can
	  be used to still detect a 6.00 driver.
	For returned versions 6.02+, INT 33/AX=0024h should be used to retrieve
	  more accurate version data. 
	True MS MOUSE drivers can also be identified by magic numbers in
	  their copyright message, stored in the driver's segment (ES).
	  These can be found by scanning the first 2 Kb of the mouse 
	  driver's segment for a string like: [new since 7.00+] 
	  "** This is Copyright 1983[-19xx] Microsoft ***" with the
	  magic number stored one byte after the signature string.

Offset	Size	Description	(Table 03187)

Note:	Versions above 7.04 (except for integrated mouse drivers) have a magic
	  number representing their version number, e.g. 0507h for version 7.05
