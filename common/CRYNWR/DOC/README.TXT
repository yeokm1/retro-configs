Hi Russell,
   Here is the source you asked for.  Its got some debug code in it (as marked) but
it seems to work, as is, very well.  I'm on a very large project so I haven't spent
the time on it that I would have liked but I plan too soon.  Hope it is of some use.
I'd appreciate any changes you make!  Keep in touch.
