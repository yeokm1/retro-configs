1. How to reach UUNET's 900 number via uucp

   Here are some sample a L.sys or Systems file lines suitable for
   UUNET's 900 number:

   # Simple line.
   uunet Any ACU 19200 1-900-468-7727 in:--in:--in: uucp
   #
   # Set up for a Telebit.
   uunet Any cua0 19200 cua0 "" ATX0S50=255S111=30DT19004687727\r CONNECT "" login: uucp

   Modify as appropriate for your site, of course, to deal with your
   local telephone system and uucp version.

   All modems on the 900 lines are Telebit T2500s.  Note that these
   modems first answer with V.32, then at 2400, 1200, and last with PEP
   tones.  This "900" number charges $.50US per minute to the caller.


2. Where the files are

   This file of instructions exists as the file uunet!~/info/archive-help
 
   uunet!~/ls-lR.Z contains a list of all files available.  This is the
   compressed output of an `ls -lR' command.  This file is updated each
   night.  (Note this file is currently about 520 Kbytes *compressed*).
   Information on other indexes can be found in uunet!~/index/README.
   The file uunet!~/info/layout details the basic organization of the
   archive.


3. File formats

   Files with .Z endings are compressed.  The uncompress program is
   available in uunet!~/compress.tar if you don't have it.

   Some very large files have been split into several files for you.
   This are usually evidenced by sequenced endings after a .Z ending.
	eg: emacs/18.57.Z.01 .. emacs/18.57.Z.39
   After you obtain all of the parts you need only concatenate them
   in the proper order.
	eg: cat 18.57.Z.* > emacs-18.57.Z


4. uunet!~/tmp

   Please refer to uunet!~/info/incoming-policy for information on the
   use of our ~ftp/tmp directory.


5. uucp file transfer advice (answers to FAQ)

   You must write files you transfer to a directory which the user
   "uucp" has write access.  That user, not you, will actually do the
   transfer.  /usr/spool/uucppublic is the common place used.

   You may see different pathnames for files in our archive which
   equate to the same thing.  Our archive is actually /usr/spool/ftp
   (aka ~ftp), but it also accessible as /usr/spool/uucppublic (aka
   ~uucp, or just ~ for UUCP).  FTP folks see the archive as just /
   (eg: ftp.uu.net:/).

   Be sure you use absolute pathnames when specifying remote filename.
   If you don't, your working directory will be prepended to the
   pathname in the command.  uunet!file and uunet!~/file are different.
   uunet!~/ is the best reference to the base of the archive via uucp.

   Permission denied messages normally indicate a file name or
   file access problem.  If you are using an old copy of our ls-lR.Z
   to find files, you may be using an old filename.  Names change as
   new versions appear, plus we're remodeling right now.

   Beware when using shell meta-characters in transfers.  You need to
   escape them in most circumstances (eg: the ! in csh).  Also note
   that there are a number of UUCP implementations which do not handle
   multi-file transfers correctly.  If you pass a * to the remote
   system you may get 'access denied' messages.  These indicate a UUCP
   problem, not a file problem.
