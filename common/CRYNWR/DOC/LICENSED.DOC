This software (PKT8000.COM, PKT8016.COM, PKT8115.COM, and
PKT8232.COM) has been licensed from Crynwr Software for use with
SMC's LMAC libraries.  The software is proprietary to SMC, who may or
may not wish to sublicense, with or without source, as they wish.

I have made this decision with some trepidation, as Crynwr has taken
action against companies that distribute Crynwr-derived drivers
without source.  In fact, SMC was perfectly willing to do a standard
full-source distribution.  It was my decision that using SMC's
standard LMAC libraries would be easier and better in the long term.

SMC's corporate philosophy in re third-party drivers continues in
Western Digital's tradition of full disclosure.  All technical
information is available, as are their LMAC libraries.  Because of
their cooperation, I feel safe in distributing these drivers without
a requirement of source availability.

If you have any questions, please direct them to me, not SMC.
