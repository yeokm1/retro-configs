	Making Novell's NetWare cooperate with other protocols.

To share an Ethernet card with multiple protocol stacks, you must
have a way to direct packets to the appropriate stack.  IPX does not
lend itself to doing this.  Some vendors have tortured their IPX into
giving up packets when it needs to.  Packet drivers (and a packet
driver IPX) are a good solution.  Novell has chosen ODI drivers (and
IPXODI) for NetWare 4.

First, install a packet driver.  Read the other documentation to see
how to do this.  Do not use the -n switch. Then run the PDIPX.COM
found in pdipx103.zip.  Then run your favorite NETx program.

That's it!

Upgrading from BYU packet driver IPX:

The pdipx is not a drop-in replacement for the BYU packet driver IPX.
It does not need the -n switch, because unlike the BYU packet driver
IPX, it understands about different frame types.  By default, it uses
the default frame type -- Novell's "Raw" IEEE 802.3.  If you're using
Ethernet_II, you must set your frame type as explained below.

Updating the IPX:

Pdipx103 has a fairly recent IPX.  If you need to regenerate it with
a newer IPX, then treat the SIPX.LAN and SIPX.OBJ files as
third-party shell drivers.  Perform the SHGEN (NetWare 2) or WSGEN
(NetWare 3) procedure per Novell's documentation.  Set the frame type
as explained below if you're using Ethernet_II framing.

Setting your frame type:

The PDIPX expects Novell's "raw 802.3" packet types by default.  If
you're using Ethernet_II framing, then run econfig on IPX.  Use
"econfig pdipx.com shell:e 8137".  This sets the packet type to
Ethernet and type 8137 (Novell).  Just running "econfig pdipx.com"
will tell you what frame type it's configured for.
