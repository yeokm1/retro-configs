   Packet Driver

   Introduction:
   -------------
   This document describes the procedure to setup the Packet driver for
   10/100M PCI Fast Ethernet Adapter.

   Location of Driver:     \RTSPKT\RTSPKT.COM

   Sample Configuration Files:
   ---------------------------
     AUTOEXEC.BAT
        RTSPKT 0x60

   Notes:
   ------
     1.  Load the packet driver using the software interrupt and any
         optional switches if required.

         Usage: RTSPKT [options] <software_int_no> [media type]

         Example: RTSPKT -i 0x7e

         The only required  parameter is the software  interrupt.  A packet
         driver needs to have a software interrupt assigned to it for other
         programs to access it. The recommended interrupt 0x7e. If you need
         any of the  options  listed below,  place them before the software
         interrupt on the command line.

         -i - Force driver to report itself as 802.3 instead of Ethernet II.
         -d - Delayed initialization.  Used for diskless booting
         -n - NetWare conversion.  Converts 802.3 packets into 8137 packets
         -w - Windows hack, obsoleted by winpkt
         -p - Promiscuous mode disable
         -h - Help
         -u - Uninstall

      2. Media type can be used to force the card to work on specific
         speed and duplex mode. If no media type if specified, then
         driver will read hardware configuration from EEPROM on the
         card. The hardware configuration can be modified by running
         'rset8139' on driver disk.

              Media type: auto    = Auto_nogotiation
                          10half  = 10M Half-Duplex
                          10full  = 10M Full-Duplex
                          100half = 100M Half-Duplex
                          100full = 100M Full-Duplex

         for example: RTSPKT 0x60 auto   ;Media type = Auto_nogotiation

      3. Type command,C:\RTSPKT 0x60 100half, the screen will appear following
         message:

         Line Speed 100 Mbps
         Half Duplex
         System: [345]86 processor, PCI bus, Two 8259s
         Packet driver software interrupt is 0x60
         Interrupt number is 0x9
         I/O port is 0x6100
         My Ethernet address is 00:40:C7:29:29:AD

      4. Installing Multiple LAN Adapters:

         If there are multiple network cards on the main board. the user
         run RTSPKT 0x60 directly, then the screen will display :

         There are 2 network cards on your main board :
         Card 1. IRQ= 0x9  I/O= 0x6100  NodeID= 00:40:C7:29:29:AD
         Card 2. IRQ= 0xA  I/O= 0x6000  NodeID= 00:40:C7:29:29:64
         Please select a Card No.(1-2): 1

         System: [345]86 processor, PCI bus, Two 8259s
         Packet driver software interrupt is 0x60
         Interrupt number is 0x9
         I/O port is 0x6100
         My Ethernet address is 00:40:C7:29:29:AD

      5. Installing multiple drivers:

         If you want to install multiple cards each connecting to different
         network, you have to install the driver multiple times, each with
         different packet interrupt number. Then modify 'ioaddr' variable
         in 'config.tel' to specify the packet inetrrupt you will use.
