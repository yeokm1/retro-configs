This installation guide describes:

o  Basic packet driver use.

o  Software interrupts.

o  How to use the packet driver to connect to a NetWare 2.2 server
   using the BYU packet driver shell. 

o  How to use the packet driver to connect to a NetWare server 
   using the Intel packet driver shell.

o  Using the packet driver with SMC adapters.

Note: This driver supports all 8432, 8432 (Enhanced), and 9332 Ethernet
	adapters.


BASIC PACKET DRIVER USE

The following section describes basic packet driver use. Since 
different networks have different requirements, you can include the 
following switches in your command lines as needed.

  -d    This switch delays the adapter's initialization until the first 
        time the packet driver is accessed. Use this switch if your 
        workstation loads the operating system over the network using a 
        Boot ROM on the SMC adapter.

  -n    This switch configures the driver to change 8137-formatted 
        packets seen by the client into IEEE802.3 packets.  Unless you 
        use the BYU's NetWare packet driver shell, you can omit this 
        switch. If you want to use 8137 packets, use "econfig" to
        configure Intel's PDIPX103 packet driver shell.

  -p    This switch disables promiscuous mode. A small level of security 
        can be achieved by disabling promiscuous mode; however, 
        disabling promiscuous mode should not be mistaken for real 
        security.
          
  -w    This switch is used with Microsoft Windows for nonresident DOS 
        TCP stacks, such as NCSA Telnet and PC-Gopher. Alternatively,
        you can use the Windows freely copyable utility, winpkt. 

  -i    The SMC packet driver can be used with both Ethernet_II and 
        IEEE 802.3 frame types. The packet driver specification, however, 
        only allows a driver to report one class which, by default, is
        Ethernet_II. If you use the packet driver with client software 
        that expects to find an IEEE 802.3 packet driver instead of an 
        Ethernet_II packet driver, use this switch to configure the 
        driver to use IEEE 802.3-formatted packets.


SOFTWARE INTERRUPTS

A packet driver provides services for client programs. These programs
access the packet driver by issuing software interrupts. 

Any software interrupt between the hexadecimal addresses of 0x60 
through 0x80 can be used with the packet driver, with the following 
exceptions:

o  0x67 is reserved for the EMS specification.

o  0x70 through 0x77 are reserved for hardware IRQ lines 8 through 15.

After you choose a software interrupt, assign that interrupt to the 
packet driver, and install the packet driver. The client programs 
will then automatically locate the packet driver by searching for
the packet driver's signature at software interrupts from 0x60 
through 0x80.


MEDIA/SPEED KEYWORDS

Following the optional slot number parameter are several optional
keywords.  If you specify media then you must specify speed (and
vice-versa).  These select the media: 

AUTONEGOTIATE - (Negotiated -- default)
MII - Media Independent Interface
UTP - Unshielded Twisted Pair
BNC - British Naval Connector (thinwire)
AUI - Attachment Unit Interface (thickwire)
S10 - Starlan 10 (pre-standard 10Base10 -- no link beat)

Other keywords select the speed.  FOUR and SIXTEEN are for Token
Ring.  TEN and HUNDRED are for Ethernet.  FD is for full duplex
interfaces.


INSTALLING THE PACKET DRIVER

The command line has the name of the packet driver, any dash options
(as listed above), the software interrupt, and any optional
parameters, such as slot number, or media/speed keywords.  The
simplest command line is "pktpwr 0x7e".  A more complex line would be
"pktpwr 0x7e aui", or "pktpwr 0x7e hundred fd".


CONNECTING TO A NetWare 2.2 SERVER USING THE BYU PACKET DRIVER SHELL

If you want to connect to a NetWare 2.2 server that, by default, is 
configured to use IEEE 802.3-type packets, use the following command 
line examples.

   PKTPWR -n 0x7e
   BYUIPX
   NETX

In this command line:

o  PKTPWR denotes the SMCPower adapter.

o  -n configures the driver to change 8137-formatted packets seen by 
   the client into IEEE802.3 packets.

o  Software interrupt setting 0x7e is the hexadecimal address 7E,
   which allows packet driver clients to use interrupt 7E to 
   communicate with the packet driver.


CONNECTING TO A NetWare SERVER USING THE INTEL PACKET DRIVER SHELL

If you want to connect to a NetWare server using the Intel packet
driver shell, pdipx103, use the following command line:

   PKTPWR 0x7e
   PDIPX
   NETX

In this line:

o  PKTPWR denotes the SMCPower adapter.

o  0x7e is the hexadecimal address 7E, which allows packet driver 
   clients to use interrupt 7E to communicate with the packet driver.


USING THE PACKET DRIVER WITH TWO SMCPower ADAPTERS IN ONE MACHINE

You can use the packet driver with two adapters in the same machine.
The first packet driver will use the first adapter found, which will
be in virtual slot number 16, the first PCI slot.  The second packet
driver should specify virtual slot number seventeen, which is the
second PCI slot.

pktpwr 0x7d
pktpwr 0x7e 17

In these lines:

o  PKTPWR denotes the SMCPower adapter.

o  0x7d is the hexadecimal address 7D, which allows packet driver 
   clients to use interrupt 7D to communicate with the packet driver.
   Similarly for 0x7e.

o  17 is the Virtual slot number.
