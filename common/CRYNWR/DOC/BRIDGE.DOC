What this document is all about
-------------------------------

        This is the documentation for the YAPCBR, Yet Another  PC
BRidge.  This  software  has  been developed by the Department of
Computer Science, IIT, Bombay, India.

General Information
-------------------

        This  bridge  belongs  to  the  class  of  Self  Learning
Transparent bridges.  You can use any Ethernet cards (or a mix of
cards from different vendors) for this bridge. All  you  need  to
have  is  the  appropriate packet drivers for these cards. Packet
drivers for most of the ethernet cards are in public  domain  and
can  be obtained from crynwr.com. This bridge can be set up using
a PC or AT (hard  disk  is  not  necessary,  a  floppy  drive  is
sufficient)  running  MSDOS  ver  3.0  or  higher.  This is not a
spanning tree bridge and hence cannot  detect  loops  in  network
paths.

Installation Procedure:
-----------------------

1. Put the ethernet cards in the PC expansion slots  with  proper
jumper/switch settings.


2. You can have up to four network segments  (so  correspondingly
four ethernet cards). Load the packet drivers for these cards. Be
careful with IRQs, I/O Base address and Memory  Base  address  if
any.   See  to it that the addresses and interrupts you have used
do not clash.


Choose  the  software  interrupts  from   0x60   onwards,   these
interrupts  have  to  be consecutive. e.g., 0x60 and 0x61 for two
cards, 0x60, 0x61, 0x62 for a three card bridge, etc.


3. The bridge maintains the  table  of  node  addresses  and  the
corresponding  segments.  This  table is built up dynamically. By
default this table is cleared every 60 minutes.  If  you  have  a
network  where  the cards are shifted from one segment to another
frequently, then set this parameter to a small value (minimum one
minute) and vice versa (the maximum is 1000 minutes).

Usage
------

A:> yapcbr <no of interfaces> [Hash Table Flush Time In Minutes]

e.g. A batch file in our department looks like this

rem   A sample batch file which loads the packet drivers and starts the bridge
rem   Load the packet driver for the network interfaces
de100pd 0x60 3 0xd000 0x300
de100pd 0x61 2 0xd200 0x320
de100pd 0x62 5 0xc000 0x340
rem This bridge has three interfaces, and hash table flush time is 40 mins
yapcbr 3 40

Runtime Commands available:

Acknowledgments
----------------

We thank all our colleagues, especially K.V. Ramani  for  helping
us  out  with  the  code and Vinod Kulkarni for testing.  We also
thank Prof. S.S.S.P.Rao for initial inspiration.

Final Comment
-------------

No flames please. This may not be the fastest  and  the  best  PC
bridge available but it works :-) We want more and more people to
test this software, and send  us  bug  reports  (along  with  bug
fixes,  if  possible),  suggestions  and  more  importantly, some
PERFORMANCE/BENCHMARK figures.
