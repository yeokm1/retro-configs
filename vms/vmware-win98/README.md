# VMware Workstation (Win 98SE)

Not exactly a retro PC but I just wanted to store the settings I use for my virtual Win 98 playground. This is typically for me to do quick and dirty testing without powering up my actual retro-PCs.

Note that the latest Sound Blaster PCI (WDM) Drivers V 5.12.01.5017 released on 19 Dec 2002 are required if you wish to use sound. These are not provided by the VMWare tools. In my VM setup, the sounds are quite choppy.
