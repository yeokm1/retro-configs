CPU Identification utility v1.27                 (c) 1997-2022 Jan Steunebrink
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file describes the use of the REPORT.BAT file.

If the CHKCPU.EXE program gives an Unkown or incorrect indication, REPORT.BAT
can be used to make a detailed report of the output of CHKCPU.EXE.
REPORT.BAT will generate a MYCPU.TXT file that contains this report.

To use REPORT.BAT, place it in the same folder as CHKCPU.exe and run REPORT.BAT.
Each time you run REPORT.BAT, a CPU report will be added to MYCPU.TXT,
without erasing any previous reports.

If you like to send the report to the author of CHKCPU, please send it by
e-mail to:  J.Steunebrink@net.hcc.nl
Thanks for your cooperation! Your report will be used to improve CHKCPU.
Regards, Jan Steunebrink.
