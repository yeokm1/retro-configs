SETUP.TXT
=========

This file contains information about problems that may occur while you are
running Windows for Workgroups Setup or when you are using terminate-and-
stay-resident (TSR) programs or drivers with Windows for Workgroups or Setup. 
If you are using a TSR or if you encounter problems setting up Windows for 
Workgroups, read this document BEFORE you run Setup again.


GENERAL SETUP NOTES
====================

This section includes notes on specific system configurations that may
prevent Setup from installing Windows for Workgroups successfully. A
possible solution to each problem is provided.

If you are using a hardware or software product listed here, follow the
proposed recommendations before you run Setup.


Network Cards
-------------
If you are using one of the following network cards, you must run Setup 
with the /i option:  

    Novell(R)/Anthem NE1500
    Novell/Anthem NE2100
    Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) AM2100
    Microdyne Exos(R) 105

To do this, type the following at the MS-DOS prompt: 

    setup /i


MS-DOS(R) Screen Savers
-----------------------
If you are using an MS-DOS screen saver, you should turn it off before
running Setup. These screen savers can cause problems when running Setup.


COMPAQ(R) Computer with MS-DOS Version 5.0 or later and EGA or VGA Display 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
If you are using the upgrade version of Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0 or later, check your
CONFIG.SYS file to make sure the following drivers (if present) appear in
this order:

    HIMEM.SYS 
    EMM386.EXE
    ANSI.SYS

Note: If you are using the COMPAQ version of MS-DOS 5.0, HIMEM.EXE is used 
      in place of HIMEM.SYS and CEMM.EXE is used in place of EMM386.EXE.

If ANSI.SYS is loaded before HIMEM.SYS or EMM386.EXE (or if you are using
COMPAQ MS-DOS 5.0 before HIMEM.EXE or CEMM.EXE), Setup may restart your
system before Windows for Workgroups is installed. Also, if you are using
the DOS=HIGH,UMB command line to load MS-DOS into upper memory, loading
EMM386.EXE (or CEMM.EXE) before loading ANSI.SYS will create the maximum
amount of upper memory space on a COMPAQ computer.


AT&T(R) Safari Computer
-----------------------
If you have an AT&T Safari computer, you cannot maintain two versions of
Windows on your system. You must upgrade over your previous version of
Windows, if you have one. If you set up Windows for Workgroups version 3.11
in its own directory, it will not use the special drivers required to run on the Safari
computer.


Displays That May Require Driver Updates with Windows for Workgroups
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Certain third-party display drivers designed for Windows version 3.0 can
cause problems with Windows for Workgroups version 3.11. The most serious
problem is a system failure while you are running Windows for Workgroups 
Setup. If you encounter this problem, run Custom Setup, and then select 
one of the standard display types, such as VGA, that is provided with 
Windows for Workgroups.

With other Windows version 3.0 display drivers, Windows for Workgroups may
be set up successfully, but TrueType fonts may not appear correctly on your
screen.

An updated driver may be available in the Windows Driver Library (WDL) or
from your display vendor or manufacturer.  For information on obtaining drivers 
from the WDL, see the "Getting Drivers from the Windows Driver Library 
(WDL)" section later in this document.

Windows version 3.0 drivers for the following display adapters may cause
problems:

* ATI Graphics Ultra, Vantage, and Mach32

  NOTE: These adapters are 8514/a-compatible and run well 
	with the 8514/a driver provided with Windows for Workgroups.

* DGIS display adapters (Direct Graphics Interface Standard)
  from Graphic Software Systems, including the following:
	
	NEC(R) MultiSynch Graphics Engine (MGE)
	Zenith(R) Z-649             
	HP(R) IGC-10, IGC-20
	GSS 1000 Series 

  NOTE: Some DGIS-based adapters are TIGA-compatible and
	run well when used with the appropriate TIGACD.EXE
	MS-DOS driver and with the TIGA driver provided with 
	Windows for Workgroups.

* HP Ultra VGA (versions earlier than 1.4 only)
* IBM(R) Image Adapter/A  
* Matrox MG Series/M-WIN Series
* Palettized VGA 640x480, 16-color (provided with Windows
  Multimedia Extensions version 1.0)
* Radius(R) SVGA MultiView

* RGDI (Renaissance Graphics Device Interface) display
  adapters from Appian, Inc., including the following:
       Appian Rendition II, IIe, II/XE, and III
       Appian GV1024
       Decpc 433

- S3 adapters, including the following:
      Orchid Fahrenheit 1280
      STB WIND/X
      Diamond Stealth VRAM


Using the ATI Mach 32 Video Adapter
-----------------------------------
Before you run Windows Setup, make sure the Mach 32 adapter is set up 
correctly. In the Mach 32 Install program, choose the Set Power-Up
Configuration option. Set the VGA Memory Size to half the RAM
available on the Mach 32 adapter. Since most Mach 32 adapters come with
1 MB of RAM, the appropriate setting is usually 512K. 

Using Stacker(R)
----------------
If you are using Stacker to compress your hard disk, you need to take the
following steps before setting up Windows for Workgroups.

*  If you want to use a swap file with Windows for Workgroups, you must
   set up the swap file on the uncompressed drive. When you set up Stacker,
   you can leave at least 1 MB of disk space uncompressed for storing system 
   files. To leave enough space for the swap file, it is recommended that the
   amount of uncompressed disk space equal at least twice the amount of 
   system memory. For example, if your system has 4 MB of memory, you should
   leave at least 8 MB of disk space uncompressed.

   If Stacker is already set up on your system and there is not enough
   uncompressed disk space for a swap file, you can run the STAC utility
   provided with Stacker to increase the amount of uncompressed disk space.
   For more information, see your Stacker documentation.

*  If you are using Stacker version 2.0 or later, Windows for Workgroups
   Setup modifies your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. When Setup
   finishes making the modifications, it displays a message notifying you 
   of the modifications. If you have used Stacker to swap your startup drive, 
   when you restart your system Stacker will ask whether you want to update 
   to the new version of the CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file. It is 
   recommended that you update.

   If you are using a version of Stacker earlier than 2.0, you may need to
   modify your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files yourself. For more
   information, see the following topic, "Modifying Your CONFIG.SYS and
   AUTOEXEC.BAT Files Yourself."

*  For best performance, do not use SMARTDrive to cache the compressed drive.
   You only need to cache the uncompressed drive. You can include options on
   the SMARTDRV.EXE line of your CONFIG.SYS file to specify which drives to
   cache.

   For example, if the Stacker swap utility swaps drives C and D, so that C
   is compressed and D is uncompressed, you would include the following line
   in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

	c:\windows\smartdrv.exe c- d+
 
For more information about swap files and using SMARTDrive, see 
your Windows for Workgroups documentation.


Solving Memory Conflicts by Using MONOUMB.386 or MONOUMB2.386
-------------------------------------------------------------
If you encounter the following message when you start Windows for
Workgroups, your display driver may be accessing the monochrome
address range (B000-B7FF), which prevents the memory manager from
using this range for upper memory blocks:

	"Windows cannot set up an upper memory block at segment B000.
	Exclude this address space by using the syntax of your memory
	manager. For more information, use an MS-DOS editor to read
	the SETUP.TXT file." 

To solve this problem, try installing MONOUMB2.386 on your system. 
MONOUMB2.386 is a device driver that allows certain memory managers to use
the monochrome address range for upper memory blocks even if your display
driver is accessing this range. 

You can get MONOUMB2.386 from Windows for Workgroups 3.1 or from Microsoft. 
It is not included on the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 disks. To install
MONOUMB2.386, carry out the following procedure:

1.  Copy and expand the MONOUMB2.38_ file to your Windows SYSTEM directory
    by typing the following at the MS-DOS prompt:

    expand  a:\monoumb2.38_  c:\windows\system\monoumb2.386

2.  Add the following setting to the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI
    file:

    device=monoumb2.386

3.  Start Windows for Workgroups.

Note: MONOUMB2.386 may not work with some memory managers, such as
      EMM386.EXE. In this case, you can try using MONOUMB.386, provided
      with the Windows Driver Library (WDL). For information on obtaining 
      drivers from the WDL, see the "Getting Drivers from the Windows Driver
      Library (WDL)" section later in this document.

You can also exclude the address region B000-B7FF. This specifies that the
memory manager should not try to use this address range for upper memory
blocks.  For information about excluding specific address ranges, see the
following topic.


Solving Memory Conflicts by Excluding an Address Range
------------------------------------------------------
If you encounter the following message when you start Windows for
Workgroups, and the address specified in the message is not B000,
you must exclude the address range:

	"Windows cannot set up an upper memory block at segment xxxx.
	Exclude this address space by using the syntax of your memory
	manager. For more information, use an MS-DOS editor to read
	the SETUP.TXT file."

If the address specified in the message is B000, you can try installing
MONOUMB2.386 or MONOUMB.386, as described in the preceding topic.

The method you use to exclude an address range depends on the memory manager
you are using. For example, if you are using EMM386.EXE, you need to remove
the I=xxxx option from the device=emm386.exe command line in your CONFIG.SYS
file, where xxxx is the address range starting at the address specified in
the error message.

If you are using QEMM, you need to include the X= option on the
device=qemm386.sys command line in your CONFIG.SYS file. For example, to
exclude the address range C000-C7FF, you would specify the following: 

	device=qemm386.sys  X=C000-C7FF

For more information about modifying your CONFIG.SYS file, see your MS-DOS
documentation. For more information about installing and configuring
EMM386.EXE, see "Managing Memory and Performance" in your Windows or Windows
for Workgroups user's guide. For information about installing and configuring
other memory managers, see the documentation provided with your memory
manager.


Modifying Your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT Files Yourself
---------------------------------------------------------
When you set up Windows for Workgroups, Setup usually places the HIMEM.SYS,
SMARTDRV.EXE, and EMM386.EXE files in the Windows directory. If the Windows
directory is on a disk that is not available when you start your computer,
such as a removable or nonlocal disk, or if Setup detects one of the
following conditions, Setup does not modify your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT
file:

* Your boot drive has been modified by a disk-compression utility.

* Your CONFIG.SYS file contains references to block device drivers.

* Your CONFIG.SYS file is set up for multiple configurations.

* There is not enough available space on your hard disk to copy the files.

* The files are already installed on your system, and Setup cannot overwrite 
  them (they are read-only).

Instead, Setup writes proposed changes to the CONFIG.WIN and AUTOEXEC.WIN or
the CONFIG.00x and AUTOEXEC.00x files. In this case, you must either move
the HIMEM.SYS, SMARTDRV.EXE, and EMM386.EXE files to a drive that is
available when you start your computer, or use a text editor to modify your
CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file so that any references to HIMEM.SYS,
SMARTDRV.EXE, and EMM386.EXE appear after the device= command line used to
load the drivers for your disk drives. Refer to the CONFIG.WIN and
AUTOEXEC.WIN or the CONFIG.00x and AUTOEXEC.00x files for the proposed
changes.


Using Multiple System Configurations with Windows for Workgroups
----------------------------------------------------------------

MS-DOS version 6.0 or higher lets you define multiple system
configurations in a single CONFIG.SYS file. When you install Windows for
Workgroups 3.11, If you are running MS-DOS version 6.0 or higher, Setup
checks the CONFIG.SYS file for the [menu] keyword section to determine
whether the CONFIG.SYS file contains multiple configurations. If so,
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Setup creates a file called CONFIG.WIN in
the Windows directory which contains the entries that need to be present in
the CONFIG.SYS file.

Setup will not automatically change the CONFIG.SYS file in order to
preserve the user's configuration in case it has difficulty interpreting the
user's environment. Once Setup has finished, you can open the
CONFIG.SYS file and the new CONFIG.WIN file that Setup created, and
merge the two together.

NOTE: [Windows for Workgroups] is used in this section to refer to the
configuration block in your CONFIG.SYS file that you use for your
Windows for Workgroups configuration.  The exact name of this block may
be different that that used here depending on the name you used for your
configuration.

When using the multiple-configuration capability in MS-DOS 6 (or any other
third-party product that provides similar capabilities), it is important 
to note the following information:

The following lines should be in either the [Common] configuration block
or the [Windows for Workgroups] configuration block of the
CONFIG.SYS file so that the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 networking
components will load properly:

device=C:\WINDOWS\HIMEM.SYS
device=C:\WINDOWS\IFSHLP.SYS

Note: If you also have a configuration block in your CONFIG.SYS file for
running Microsoft LAN Manager or Windows for Workgroups 3.1 that you
wish to continue to use after installing Windows for Workgroups 3.11,
place the IFSHLP.SYS device driver line in your Windows for
Workgroups 3.11 configuration block instead of in the [common]
configuration block. If you place IFSHLP.SYS in your [common]
configuration block, it will prevent the network drivers for LAN Manager
or Windows for Workgroups 3.1 from loading properly.

Other device driver lines that can be in either the [Common] configuration
block or the [Windows for Workgroups] configuration block include:

device=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE

device=C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE /DOUBLE_BUFFER

If you were previously using Windows for Workgroups 3.1, you can
remove the following device driver lines from the [Windows for
Workgroups] block in your CONFIG.SYS file if they are still present once
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 has been installed.

c:\windows\protman.dos /i:c:\windows

c:\windows\<network card driver>.DOS { for example, EXP16.DOS }

c:\windows\workgrp.sys

If these device driver lines appear in your CONFIG.SYS file more than
once, Windows for Workgroups Setup only removes their first occurrence.
If your [Windows for Workgroups] block is not the first one in your
CONFIG.SYS file, you may need to move them by hand from the
[Windows for Workgroups] block by hand.

Third-party network transports should be moved to the transports= line in
the [network drivers] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.

The CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files are no longer used to load
the NDIS network adapter card drivers and network protocol drivers.
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 specifies the network configuration in the
SYSTEM.INI and PROTOCOL.INI files.

If you are using different network adapter card drivers or network
protocols and want to switch between these different configurations, the
SYSTEM.INI and PROTOCOL.INI files must be changed to reflect the
configuration settings. The simplest way to enable a quick change of
configurations is to maintain separate copies of SYSTEM.INI and
PROTOCOL.INI files that reflect the adapters or protocols you need to
support.


Setting Up an XGA Video Adapter on a PS/2(R) Model 75 or 90
-----------------------------------------------------------
If you have a PS/2 model 75 or 90 with an XGA video adapter, Windows for
Workgroups Setup will configure the display adapter for 16-color, 640x480
resolution. Do not change this configuration during Setup. Specifying a
different XGA configuration while setting up Windows for Workgroups may 
cause Setup to fail.

After you have successfully installed Windows, you can configure your XGA to
use a different resolution or 256 colors, if your monitor supports it. For
more information on how to do this, see the topic "IBM XGA: Configuring
Color and Resolution" in the README.WRI online document.

If you are using the plasma screen on the PS/2 model 75, use ONLY the
640x480, 16-color configuration. If you change this configuration, you
return to the MS-DOS prompt when you try to start Windows.


Setting up an IBM Token Ring 4/16Mbs Network Card on a Microchannel (MCA) Computer 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have a Microchannel computer, and you are installing Windows for Workgroups 
support for the IBM Token Ring 4/16Mbs network card, you must make sure the 
Maximum Transmits parameter is set no higher than 1024. If you try to use a higher 
value, the network card will not work with your computer.


Correcting the "Out of Environment Space" Error Message
-------------------------------------------------------
If you receive an "out of environment space" message when starting Windows,
you can solve the problem in either of two ways:

*  Increase the size of your environment by adding the SHELL= command
   line to your CONFIG.SYS file. See your MS-DOS documentation for more
   information about the SHELL command and about modifying your CONFIG.SYS
   file.

*  Move the SET commands in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to the beginning of
   the file so that they run before the commands that load
   terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs or drivers, such as
   SMARTDrive.


Using Multimedia Extensions Version 1.0 with Windows for Workgroups
-------------------------------------------------------------------
To use the Multimedia Extensions with Windows for Workgroups, first
set up Windows with Multimedia Extensions version 1.0. Then upgrade to 
Windows for Workgroups by installing it into the same directory. If 
you set up Windows for Workgroups before setting up Multimedia 
Extensions, not all the files will be properly installed.

See the README.WRI online document for more information about running
Multimedia Extensions with Windows for Workgroups.

Getting Drivers from the Windows Driver Library (WDL)
============================================================

If you have a modem, you can download Windows Driver Library files from network services, including CompuServe®,  GEnie™, Microsoft OnLine, or various user-group bulletin boards (such as the bulletin-board services on the Association of PC User Groups network). If you have a modem, you can download Windows Driver Library components from network services, including CompuServe®,  GEnie™, Microsoft OnLine, or various user-group bulletin boards (such as the bulletin-board services on the Association of PC User Groups network). Files from the Windows Driver Library is also available from Microsoft Download Service (MSDL), which you can reach by calling (206) 936-MSDL (936-6735) any time except between 1:00 A.M. and 2:30 A.M. Pacific time. To use MSDL, use the following communications settings:
Baud rate
1200, 2400, or 9600
Data bits
8

Parity
None
Stop bits
1


People within the United States who do not have a modem can order individual files on disks from the Windows Driver Library by calling Microsoft Product Support Services at (206) 637-7098 or (206) 635-4948 (text telephone).



USING TERMINATE-AND-STAY-RESIDENT (TSR) PROGRAMS AND DRIVERS
WITH WINDOWS FOR WORKGROUPS
============================================================

The "Program Listing" section of this document lists a number of terminate-
and-stay-resident (TSR) programs and drivers that are known to cause
problems when running with Windows for Workgroups. Some of the problems
you may encounter include system failures or incorrect screen displays.
In some cases, we have included solutions or workarounds for the problems.

When you install Windows for Workgroups, Setup searches your AUTOEXEC.BAT
and CONFIG.SYS files for references to TSR programs and drivers and scans
memory for TSRs that are currently running. If Setup detects a TSR that is
known to cause problems when running with Windows for Workgroups, a message
appears asking whether you want to continue or quit Setup.

If you receive such a message, carry out the following procedure:

1. Locate your TSR in the "Program Listing" section of this document.
   Determine whether the situation prevents Setup from successfully
   installing Windows for Workgroups.

2. If the situation does not affect Setup, continue setting up Windows for 
   Workgroups by following the instructions on your screen.
   
   If the situation does affect Setup and prevents it from installing
   Windows for Workgroups, quit Setup, and then carry out the following
   steps.

3. Quit the TSR and remove all references to it from your AUTOEXEC.BAT and 
   CONFIG.SYS files. For more information, see the documentation for your
   TSR.

4. Restart your computer.

5. Run Windows for Workgroups Setup again.

After Windows for Workgroups is successfully set up, you may want to
restore your TSRs. 

Setup cannot detect all the TSRs or drivers included in the "Program
Listing" section. The TSRs and drivers that Setup can detect are listed
in the in the [incomptsr1] and [incomptsr2] sections of the SETUP.INF
file.


PROGRAM LISTING
===============

This section describes some problems that you might encounter while using a 
TSR with Windows for Workgroups. It does not include all possible problems 
that can occur.


386MAX(R) 
---------
The documentation for 386MAX recommends against setting the EXT parameter
below 64. If you set this parameter to 0, Setup will fail.

See the README.WRI online document for more information about running 386MAX
with Windows for Workgroups.


386MAX Disk-Cache Utility (QCACHE.EXE)
--------------------------------------
Do not use this disk-cache utility simultaneously with SMARTDrive. There is
no reason to use two disk-cache utilities with Windows for Workgroups. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows for Workgroups,
instead.


All Charge 386 Version 3.1 
-------------------------- 
ALLEMM4.SYS is a memory manager that causes problems with Setup and Windows
for Workgroups. If you encounter problems running this program with Windows
for Workgroups, it is recommended that you use EMM386.EXE and HIMEM.SYS,
provided with Windows for Workgroups, to manage memory instead.


Anarkey Version 4.00
--------------------
Do not run Windows for Workgroups when Anarkey version 4.00 is running. With 
some memory configurations, running Anarkey version 4.00 with Windows for 
Workgroups may cause unpredictable system failures. In rare cases, this 
program can also corrupt hard-disk data. Also, Windows for Workgroups might 
not start when this program is running.

Version 4.01 may correct these problems. Contact Moderne Software for a free
upgrade to Anarkey 4.01.


Anarkey Version 4.01
--------------------
Do not load Anarkey HIGH before starting Windows for Workgroups. If you load 
Anarkey HIGH, your system may fail when you try to start an application.


APPEND (MS-DOS)
---------------
Do not use the APPEND utility with Windows for Workgroups. It prevents
Windows and Windows-based applications from creating valid Well-Formed-Path
(WFP) names for the files they are using. (A WFP is the complete name of a
file, including the drive letter and full path specification, starting from
the root directory.)


ASP Integrity Toolkit Version 3.7
---------------------------------
This virus-protection program can cause problems when you are running Windows
for Workgroups Setup, including system failure, automatic restarting of the 
system, and keyboard failure. You should turn off protection in the Toolkit 
before you set up Windows for Workgroups. For information about how to do 
this, see your ASP Integrity documentation.


Autocon Version 2.0e 
--------------------
Autocon enables you to select up to 50 different configurations when you
start your system. To do this, it modifies your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT 
files, based on information in its database (AUTOCON.DAT), when you restart 
your system from within Autocon.

Windows for Workgroups Setup modifies only the first section in your 
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. If you want to use specific
configurations with Windows, you must run Autocon and then manually
edit the configurations in the database that you want to use. You
must do this after setting up Windows for Workgroups. For your changes
to take effect, you must restart your system from within Autocon. For
more information, see your Autocon documentation.


Bootcon Version 1.60
--------------------
Bootcon enables you to maintain different system-configuration information
in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. You can then select the
configuration you want to use from a menu when you start your system.

Setup modifies the first section in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
files and may modify certain other sections that contain network drivers
(for example, LAN Manager drivers and NetWare drivers may be deleted). After
you set up Windows for Workgroups, you must edit the sections of those files
that contain other configurations you want to use. For more information, see
your Bootcon documentation.


BOOT.SYS
--------
BOOT.SYS enables you to maintain different system-configuration information
in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. You can then select the
configuration you want to use from a menu when you start your system.

Setup modifies the first section in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
files and may modify certain other sections that contain network drivers
(for example, LAN Manager drivers and NetWare drivers may be deleted). After
you set up Windows for Workgroups, you must edit the sections of those files
that contain other configurations you want to use. For more information, see
your BOOT.SYS documentation.


CACHE.EXE Disk-Cache Utility
----------------------------
Do not use two disk-cache utilities with Windows for Workgroups. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows for Workgroups,
and remove all references to other disk-cache utilities from your CONFIG.SYS
and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. (If CACHE.EXE is detected, Setup removes it from your
CONFIG.SYS file for you.)


CACHE.SYS Disk-Cache Utility
----------------------------
This disk-cache utility will not work properly with SMARTDrive. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows for Workgroups,
and remove all references to other disk-cache utilities from your
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. (If CACHE.SYS is detected, Setup removes
it from your CONFIG.SYS file for you.)


CED Version 1.0e
----------------
Using CED with Windows for Workgroups may cause problems, including
system failure. It is recommended that you do not use CED with Windows for
Workgroups.


Central Point Anti-Virus Version 1.1 (VSAFE.COM/VSAFE.SYS)
----------------------------------------------------------
VSAFE.COM/VSAFE.SYS should not be loaded when you set up Windows for
Workgroups. Otherwise, Setup may not run properly. After you set up
Windows for Workgroups, you can load VSAFE.

If you are upgrading to Windows for Workgroups 3.11, you must also 
delete all the CHKLIST.MS files that VSAFE  has created before you run Setup. 

Because Windows uses the disk for memory swapping, you should turn off the
VSAFE write-protection option when you run Windows for Workgroups.

For more information, see the Central Point Anti-Virus documentation.


CMDEDIT.COM Version 2.0
-----------------------
If this command-line editor is loaded before Windows for Workgroups is
started, it may cause a General Protection Fault when you run multiple
MS-DOS Prompts.


Cubit Version 3.01
------------------
When you are using Cubit with Windows for Workgroups, do not compress the
Windows SYSTEM directory or any file that is loaded from your CONFIG.SYS
file. Compressing these files could cause problems.

Before you upgrade to Windows for Workgroups, make sure that the earlier
version of Windows is uncompressed on your hard disk. You may recompress the
files after you have successfully set up Windows for Workgroups.


Data Physician Plus Version 2.0 (VirALERT)
------------------------------------------
It is recommended that you do not set up Windows for Workgroups while
VirALERT is running. If you do, VirALERT will display a warning message
every few seconds while Setup is running.

After you have set up Windows for Workgroups, you can run VirALERT. Press
ALT+V to display the VirALERT menu. You can use the commands on this menu to
disable and enable VirALERT.


DOSCUE.COM Command-Line Editor
------------------------------
The DOSCUE command-line editor produces unexpected results when used with
Windows for Workgroups. It is recommended that you do not use this editor
with Windows for Workgroups.


Doubledisk Version 2.5
----------------------
Windows for Workgroups may try to access "phantom" disk drives if you use it
with Doubledisk. Phantom drives occur when you use Doubledisk to create a
compressed drive. For example, if you have drives A, B, and C on your
computer and you use Doubledisk to create drive F, Windows for Workgroups
and MS-DOS recognize drives D and E as valid drives, even though they do
not actually exist. You can use the DRVOFF utility to prevent Windows from
recognizing phantom drives. Contact Vertisoft to order a copy of the DRVOFF
utility.


Fastopen (MS-DOS)
-----------------
Fastopen is a RAM-resident utility. Problems involving the file allocation
table (FAT) may occur if Fastopen is used with disk-defragmenting utilities. 
In low-memory situations, you may need to remove Fastopen for Windows for 
Workgroups to run properly.


Flash Disk-Cache Utility (FLASH.EXE)
------------------------------------
Do not use this disk-cache utility simultaneously with SMARTDrive. There is
no reason to use two disk-cache utilities with Windows for Workgroups. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows for
Workgroups, instead.


Graphics (MS-DOS)
-----------------
Loading Graphics from MS-DOS Prompt within Windows can cause unexpected
results when you are printing. The active MS-DOS Prompt will send its 
output to the printer. Switching between multiple MS-DOS Prompts may 
result in mixed printing jobs.


HPEMM386.SYS and HPEMM486.SYS
-----------------------------
These expanded-memory managers are incompatible with Windows for Workgroups.
It is recommended that you use EMM386.EXE to manage memory instead.


HPMM.SYS - HP Memory Manager
----------------------------
When HPMM.SYS is running, you cannot set up Windows for Workgroups. 
You should remove all references to HPMM.SYS from your CONFIG.SYS 
and AUTOEXEC.BAT files before setting up Windows for Workgroups.


Hyperdisk Disk-Cache Utility 
----------------------------
Do not use this disk-cache utility simultaneously with SMARTDrive. There is
no reason to use two disk-cache utilities with Windows for Workgroups. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows for Workgroups,
instead.


IBM VDISK.SYS (RAM Disk Utility)
--------------------------------
VDISK.SYS is incompatible with Windows for Workgroups because it occupies
extended memory required to run Windows for Workgroups. This utility prevents
any XMS-compatible memory manager from loading.


IEMM.SYS Memory Manager
-----------------------
The IEMM.SYS memory manager is incompatible with Windows for Workgroups. It
is recommended that you remove all references to IEMM.SYS from your
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files and use EMM386.EXE, provided with Windows
for Workgroups, to manage memory instead.


ICACHE.SYS Disk-Cache Utility
-----------------------------
Do not use two disk-cache utilities with Windows for Workgroups.
It is recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows for
Workgroups, and remove all references to other disk-cache utilities from
your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. (If ICACHE.SYS is detected, Setup
removes it from your CONFIG.SYS file for you.)


IBMCACHE.SYS Disk-Cache Utility
-------------------------------
Do not use two disk-cache utilities with Windows for Workgroups.
It is recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows for
Workgroups, and remove all references to other disk-cache utilities from

removes it from your CONFIG.SYS file for you.)


Intel(R) Expanded-Memory Emulator (ILIM386.SYS)
-----------------------------------------------
The ILIM386.SYS expanded-memory emulator, provided with the Intel
Inboard(TM)/386 product, is incompatible with Windows for Workgroups. It is
recommended that you remove all references to this emulator from your
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files before setting up Windows for Workgroups.


JOIN (MS-DOS)
-------------
Do not add or remove "joined" drives while you are running Windows for 
Workgroups. If you use the JOIN command before starting Windows for 
Workgroups and do not change the state of the joined drives from MS-DOS 
Prompt within Windows, Windows for Workgroups will work properly. It is 
recommended that you do not use joined drives at all if you plan to run 
Windows.


KEYB.COM (MS-DOS)
-----------------
If you use command-line options to load KEYB.COM, it is recommended that you
load it before starting Windows for Workgroups. After it is loaded, you can
change the keyboard configuration from MS-DOS Prompt within Windows at any
time. If you do not load KEYB.COM before starting Windows, you may encounter
problems when using a KEYB command that includes an option in an MS-DOS
Prompt. However, you can use the KEYB command without options at any time to
display code-page information.


LANSight(TM) Version 2.0
------------------------
LANSight is a utility that you can use to control and monitor other
workstations attached to a Novell network. In some cases, version 2.0 of
LANSight may cause the workstation running Windows for Workgroups to
fail.


Lasertool Control Panel Version 2.2
-----------------------------------
If you load version 2.2 of the Lasertool Control Panel program (PCPANEL.EXE)
from Windows for Workgroups, your system may fail. This program works
properly if you load it before you start Windows for Workgroups.
 

Le Menu Version 1.0
-------------------
When you are using Le Menu version 1.0 with Windows for Workgroups, 
environment information such as PATH, PROMPT, and WINDIR may be lost if you 
start MS-DOS Prompt from within Windows. If you want to start Windows for 
Workgroups by using a Le Menu menu command, it is recommended that you set 
up Windows for Workgroups as a Batch-File menu command so that COMMAND.COM 
will load before starting Windows for Workgroups. For more information, see 
your Le Menu documentation.


LOCKIT Version 3.3 (PC Vault, Secure It)
----------------------------------------
Version 3.3 of these programs strips out spaces from the load= command line
in the WIN.INI file. Later versions may correct this problem.


Logitech(TM) Mouse Software Version 5.0/6.0 (CLICK, LOGIMENU)
-------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to use CLICK and LOGIMENU from MS-DOS Prompt within Windows, you
must load the TSRs from that MS-DOS Prompt, even if you loaded the TSRs
before starting Windows for Workgroups. When you quit Windows for
Workgroups, you must reload the TSRs for them to work properly from the
command prompt outside of Windows, even if you loaded them from MS-DOS
Prompt within Windows.


Mace Disk-Cache Utility (MCACHE.SYS)
------------------------------------
This disk-cache utility will not work properly with SMARTDrive. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows for Workgroups,
and remove all references to other disk-cache utilities from your
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. (If Mace is detected, Setup removes it
from your CONFIG.SYS file for you.)


Maximizer Memory Manager (MAXIMIZE.COM)
---------------------------------------
If you are using the Maximizer memory manager, you may not be able to set up
or start Windows for Workgroups. Make sure that you are using only one
memory manager with Windows for Workgroups. It is recommended that you use
HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE, which are provided with Windows for Workgroups, to
manage memory instead.


Mirror (MS-DOS)
---------------
If you run Mirror from Windows for Workgroups by using the Run command 
or from a command line within an MS-DOS box, it creates an inaccurate
MIRROR.FIL file. You should run Mirror only before you run Windows. 

If you run Mirror with the /t option and then start Windows, you cannot 
remove it from memory by using the MIRROR /u command until you exit Windows. 
This will cause an error message to appear.


NDOSEDIT.COM
------------
You may have problems loading this command-line editor. Also, it may cause
unexpected results when running with Windows for Workgroups.


NetRoom Memory Manager (RM386.SYS)
----------------------------------
With some older versions of NetRoom, you may encounter problems setting up
Windows for Workgroups. In this case, contact Helix Software for the most
current version of NetRoom.


NetWare(R) NetBIOS
------------------
The NetWare NetBIOS TSR is incompatible with Windows for Workgroups in
many configurations. In most cases, Setup will detect NetWare NetBIOS and
remove the startup command from your system. However, if you have NetWare
NetBIOS set up to start from a location other than your AUTOEXEC.BAT file
(for example, from a batch file), Setup cannot detect it. In this case, you
need to remove NetWare NetBIOS manually. Windows for Workgroups 3.11 
includes an IPX/SPX compatible protocol that you can use instead of NetBIOS.
For information about configuring Windows for Workgroups to work with it, see the
NETWORKS.WRI online document.


Newspace Version 1.07
---------------------
This disk-compression utility is incompatible with Windows for Workgroups
and may cause several problems.

the most current version of this program.


Norton Desktop for Windows (EP.EXE)
-----------------------------------
If the data-recovery program Erase Protect (EP.EXE) is loaded from your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file, you need to disable it when you are setting up Windows 
for Workgroups, especially if you are upgrading over a previous version of
Windows. Erase Protect tries to save copies of all deleted files, which can
cause you to run out of disk space while running Setup.

It is recommended that you run Erase Protect with a permanent swap file. 
If you are using a temporary swap file, you need to exclude files that have 
a .TMP or .SWP extension from erase protection.


Norton Utilities(R) Version 5.0 (DISKREET, NCACHE)
--------------------------------------------------
This program is incompatible with Windows for Workgroups and may cause your
system to fail. It is recommended that you upgrade to the most recent
version of Norton Utilities to correct problems.


Norton Utilities Version. 6.01 (NCACHE)
---------------------------------------
Some versions of NCACHE may prevent you from setting up or starting Windows
for Workgroups. This is more likely to happen if NCACHE is set up as an EMS
cache. Setting up NCACHE as an XMS cache instead may solve the problem.

You may also encounter additional problems using NCACHE. New versions may
correct these problems. For an updated version of NCACHE, contact Symantec
Corporation. In the meantime, you can use SMARTDrive, which is provided with
Windows for Workgroups.


Norton Utilities Version 6.01 (DISKMON)
---------------------------------------
It is recommended that you do not use DISKMON version 6.01 with Windows for

expanded memory. To get an upgraded version of PC-Kwik, contact MultiSoft.


PC-Kwik Disk-Cache Utility (PC-KWIK.EXE)
----------------------------------------
Do not use this disk-cache utility simultaneously with SMARTDrive. There is
no reason to use two disk-cache utilities with Windows for Workgroups. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows for Workgroups,
instead.


PC-Kwik Version. 1.59 (PCK.EXE, PSKSCRN.EXE, PCKEY.COM)
-------------------------------------------------------
If version 1.59 of PC-KWIK is loaded before setting up Windows for
Workgroups, Setup may fail. PC-KWIK Version 2.0 may correct this problem.


PCSXMAEM.SYS Utility
--------------------
This utility is incompatible with Windows for Workgroups. You should remove
all references to it from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files before
setting up or starting Windows for Workgroups. PCSXMAEM.SYS is similar
to XMAEM.SYS. It has been renamed and slightly modified. It is provided with
current versions of the IBM PC/3270 emulator.


PCSX2EMS.SYS
------------
Windows for Workgroups will run correctly with PCSX2EMS.SYS if it is loaded
on a computer that has an XMA board installed. Otherwise, this program is
incompatible with Windows for Workgroups. PCSX2EMS.SYS is provided with the
IBM PC/3270 emulator.


PC Tools Deluxe(TM) Version 7.1 (DATAMON)
-----------------------------------------
If you load PC Tools DATAMON using the \SENTRY+ option, Setup may fail if
you are low on disk space. Do not use the \SENTRY+ option when loading
DATAMON.

Do not load DATAMON after loading SMARTDrive. If DATAMON is loaded after
SMARTDrive, your system may fail. See the PC Tools documentation for
information about how to unload DATAMON.


PC Tools Deluxe Version 6.0 (DESKTOP)
-------------------------------------
If you try to start PC Tools from a MS-DOS Prompt within Windows for
Workgroups, your system may fail or restart itself. These problems also 
occur if you use MS-DOS commands from a MS-DOS Prompt within Windows.

Version 7.0 of PC Tools may correct these problems. However, do not load
DESKTOP from a MS-DOS Prompt if it was loaded before starting Windows for
Workgroups. If you do, your system may fail when you quit Windows for
Workgroups. It is recommended that you run DESKTOP from its PIF, provided
with Windows for Workgroups.


PC Tools Deluxe Version 7.1 (VDEFEND)
-------------------------------------
Setup may not work properly if VDEFEND is loaded before running Setup. You
may load VDEFEND after setting up Windows for Workgroups.


PC Tools(TM) Disk-Cache Utility (PC-CACHE.COM)
----------------------------------------------
Do not use this disk-cache utility simultaneously with SMARTDrive. There is
no reason to use two disk-cache utilities with Windows. It is recommended
that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows for Workgroups, instead.

---------------------------------
If you are using the QMAPS memory manager, you may not be able to set up or
start Windows for Workgroups. New versions may correct these problems. For
an updated version of QMAPS, contact Quadtel. In the meantime, you can use
HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE, provided with Windows for Workgroups, to manage
memory instead.


RAMTYPE.SYS - AST RAMpage!(R) Boards
------------------------------------
The RAMTYPE.SYS driver is incompatible with Windows for Workgroups. It is
recommended that you remove this driver before setting up Windows for
Workgroups. If you load the driver from your CONFIG.SYS file, comment
out the command line for the driver as follows:

   rem RAMTYPE.SYS 

Windows for Workgroups will run correctly without RAMTYPE.SYS. However,
other drivers that rely on RAMTYPE.SYS will not load and applications will
not be able to use the expanded memory on your system.

After you set up Windows for Workgroups, you can use version 1.2 and later
of RAMTYPE.SYS with Windows for Workgroups. If you are using an earlier
version on an IBM PS/2 or Micro Channel Architecture computer and your
RAMpage! board is configured for expanded and extended memory, you need to
upgrade your AST RAMTYPE.SYS driver after you set up Windows for Workgroups.
You will also need to remove the "rem" command from your CONFIG.SYS file so
that RAMTYPE.SYS will load properly.


Secretdisk II Disk-Cache Utility (FAST512.SYS)
----------------------------------------------
This disk-cache utility will not work properly with SMARTDrive. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows for Workgroups,
and remove all references to other disk-cache utilities from your
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. (If this utility is detected, Setup
removes it from your CONFIG.SYS file for you).


SideKick(R) Versions 1.0 and 2.0 and SideKick Plus
--------------------------------------------------
Miscellaneous problems may occur when you run SideKick as a TSR with Windows
for Workgroups. It is recommended that you use a PIF to run SideKick as
an MS-DOS--based application instead of loading it as a TSR.


SoftIce Debugger
----------------
If SoftIce is loaded, Setup will fail when starting the Windows portion of
the program. It is recommended that you unload SoftIce before you set up
Windows for Workgroups.


SpeedFXR
--------
This program is incompatible with Windows for Workgroups when running as
a TSR. It tries to increase the speed of the floppy disk drives, but slows
them instead. To get the best results, use the -X option when loading
SpeedFXR. This will prevent SpeedFXR from remaining in memory and affecting
the speed of the floppy disk drives.


SUBST (MS-DOS)
--------------
Do not add or remove "substituted" drives while you are running Windows for
Workgroups. If you use the SUBST command before starting Windows for
Workgroups and do not change the state of the substituted drives from an
MS-DOS Prompt within Windows, Windows for Workgroups will work properly.


Super PC-Kwik Disk-Cache Utility (SUPERPCK.EXE)
-----------------------------------------------
Do not use this disk-cache utility simultaneously with SMARTDrive. There is
no reason to use two disk-cache utilities with Windows. It is recommended
that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows for Workgroups, instead.


Trantor T100 Host Adapter Driver (TSCSI.SYS)
--------------------------------------------
(For SCSI hard disk drives) - If you use the Trantor T100 driver
(TSCSI.SYS), you must use version 4.33d or higher. Earlier versions identify
the SCSI hard disk drive as a removable drive. This may cause problems when
you are using File Manager--for example, your system could fail while you 
format a drive, or you could get unexpected results when you delete files.
To get an updated driver, contact Trantor Systems, Ltd.


UMB PRO Version 1.07
--------------------
If you are running UMB PRO, you may experience problems running Windows for
Workgroups. In some cases, your system may fail. Make sure that you are
using only one memory manager with Windows for Workgroups. It is recommended
that you use HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE, which are provided with Windows for 
Workgroups, to manage memory instead.


Vaccine
-------

running Windows for Workgroups when Vaccine is loaded.


VIREX-PC Version 1.11
---------------------
If VIREXPC.COM is loaded, Setup and Windows for Workgroups will fail
when KRNL386.EXE performs a write operation. Also, the first time Windows
for Workgroups is loaded, you may be returned to the MS-DOS prompt.


Virus Prevention Plus Version 5.0
---------------------------------
If Virus Prevention Plus is loaded, you may not be able to set up Windows 
for Workgroups successfully. You may also encounter problems when you run
Windows for Workgroups. The Keyboard Lock program may cause Windows for 
Workgroups to fail.


Virusafe Version 4.0
--------------------
If this program is loaded as a TSR, Setup may fail while you are setting 
up Windows for Workgroups. It is recommended that you load Virusafe by using 
the /C- option. This option turns off the memory-change detection provided 
with Virusafe. Version 4.5 may correct this problem. For more information, 
see your Virusafe documentation.


XMAEM.SYS
---------
XMAEM.SYS is a device that causes extended memory to act like XMA. This
