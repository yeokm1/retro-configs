diskettes. Label the diskettes EtherDisk 1 and EtherDisk 2.

-PACKET driver
-Help text files
-DOS utilities

      enter the following command from the Run option 
      of the Windows Start menu:
   
    d:\installs\setup.exe
   
    where d:\ represents the letter name of the 
    CD-ROM drive.

3.  Click NIC Software.

4.  Click NIC Drivers and Diagnostics.

5.  Click Installation Utilities.

6.  Click Create Installation Diskettes.
    The EtherCD Diskette Creation Utility Welcome 
    screen appears.

7.  Click Next.

     EtherDisk 1 in the PC, and then click Next.
     Files are copied.
