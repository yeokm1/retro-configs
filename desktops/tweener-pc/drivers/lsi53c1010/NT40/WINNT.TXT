Installation Guide for the Symbios SDMS Drivers: SYMC8XX.SYS V4.15.00
                                                 SYM_HI.SYS  V4.13.00
                                                 SYM_U3.SYS  V5.05.00

This file describes the features and use of the Symbios SDMS device 
drivers for the Windows 4.0 operating system environment. LSI Logic 
uses the same filenames for their drivers for different Windows operating
systems. The driver files are packaged either in separate subdirectories
based on the Windows operating system or on different flex disks.

To determine the driver file for Windows NT 4.0, note that the filename ends 
with ".sys". For example, SYMC8XX.SYS. (The same is true for Windows 2000.)
To determine the operating system version, go into Windows Explorer, 
display the driver file, right click on the filename, click on Properties,
click on the Version tab. Finally, click on the Internal Filename in the
lower section. For Windows NT 4.0, the filename appears as filename (NT 4.0).
For example, SYMC8XX.SYS (NT 4.0).

******************** Introduction for Windows NT 4.0 ******************** 

Windows NT 4.0 is an operating system designed to run on processors using 
current technology. It provides a graphical user interface environment
incorporating many high-level features (refer to the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
documentation for details). An I/O manager handles I/O requests in Windows
NT 4.0. To address a SCSI peripheral, the I/O manager goes through the
appropriate drivers. Class drivers for hard disk, floptical, CD-ROM, printer,
and scanner peripherals are provided in Windows NT 4.0.
  
Other class drivers, provided by peripheral manufacturers, may be added to 
support new devices. Tape device support is built into the operating system 
itself and does not require a class driver. Microsoft provides the port
driver and LSI Logic provides the miniport drivers, which are called
SYMC8XX.SYS, SYM_HI.SYS, and SYM_U3.SYS. These drivers complete the path to
a Symbios controller or processor with an optional SDMS SCSI BIOS. The next
sections describe these drivers and their installation. 


*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Features *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *

*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  Symbios Devices Supported *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * 

The SYMC8XX.SYS driver is named "Symbios PCI (53C8XX)" for driver
installation. It supports the following devices and Symbios host adapters
based on those devices:

o  SYM53C810, SYM53C810A, SYM53C810AE (SYM8100S, SYM8100ASP, SYM20810)
o  SYM53C815 (SYM815XS, SYM8150SP)
o  SYM53C825, SYM53C825A (SYM8250S, SYM8251S, SYM8251D, SYM8250ASP,
   SYM8251ASP, SYM8251AD)
o  SYM53C860, SYM53C860AE (SYM8600SP, SYM20860)
o  SYM53C875, SYM53C875E (SYM8750SP, SYM8751SP, SYM8751SPE, SYM8751D)
o  SYM53C876 (SYM22801, SYM22802)
o  SYM53C885 
o  SYM53C895, (SYM8951U, SYM8952U)


The SYM_HI.SYS driver is named "Symbios PCI High Performance Driver" for
driver installation. It supports the following devices and associated Symbios
host adapters:

o  SYM53C895A (SYM8953U)
o  SYM53C896 (SYM22910, SYM21002, SYM22902)

The SYM_U3.SYS driver is named "Symbios Ultra3 PCI SCSI Driver" for
driver installation. It supports the following device and associated Symbios
host adapter:

o SYM53C1010-33 (SYM8955U, SYM21040)

*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Description *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *

SYMC8XX.SYS, SYM_HI.SYS, and SYM_U3.SYS are designed to Microsoft's speci-
fication for miniport drivers. These drivers allow connection of SCSI devices
including disk drives, CD-ROMs, and tape drives for PCI-based machines. To
support a new SCSI device, the Windows NT architecture requires that a class 
driver for that type device be present (usually supplied by Microsoft, or 
possibly by the peripheral manufacturer). No changes to SYMC8XX.SYS, 
SYM_HI.SYS, or SYM_U3.SYS are required. These drivers are only supported under
Windows NT 4.0 and later versions. They do not run under earlier versions of
Windows NT.

SCSI commands are passed directly from a Windows application to the SCSI 
devices by using the SCSI pass-through facility (refer to the Microsoft 
Windows NT 4.0 documentation for details). This facility allows
applications to directly control and access SCSI devices by filling in a 
data structure and calling into the port or class driver.

The SYMC8XX.SYS and SYM_HI.SYS drivers support Ultra SCSI protocol, providing
twice the raw data transfer rate of Fast SCSI for disk drives and Symbios host
adapters that support Ultra SCSI. These drivers also support Ultra2 protocol,
providing quadruple the raw data transfer rate of Fast SCSI. The SYM_U3.SYS
driver supports Ultra160 SCSI protocol providing 80 Mbytes/s of data transfer
and up to 160 Mbytes/s data transfer for double transition.

CAUTION: Ultra SCSI requires more stringent SCSI bus cabling setups than Fast 
         SCSI. Ultra2 and Ultra160 SCSI require low-voltage differential (LVD)
         termination.

NOTE: The Symbios driver bundled in Windows NT 4.0 is named SYMC810.SYS. 
      When Windows NT selects the bundled Symbios driver during setup, 
      the driver information (that is, "Symbios C810 PCI SCSI Host 
      Adapter") appears. Although this implies that the driver only 
      supports the SYM53C810, it actually supports the SYM53C810, SYM53C810A,
      SYM53C815, SYM53C825, SYM53C825A, SYM53C860, SYM53C875, and SYM53C876.
      This driver does not "see" or support the SYM53C885, SYM53C895,  
      SYM53C896, SYM53C895A, SYM53C1010-33 chipsets and any newer host adapters
      based on these chipsets that Symbios currently produces.
      
      Keep in mind that the Windows NT 4.0 setup only displays the driver 
      information, and not every controller found by that driver.


********** Installing the SYMC8XX.SYS/SYM_HI.SYS/SYM_U3.SYS Driver *********** 

This section provides installation instructions for new and existing Windows
NT systems. 

*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * New System Installation *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * 

This procedure installs the SYMC8XX.SYS, SYM_HI.SYS, or SYM_U3.SYS driver onto 
a Windows NT 4.0 system. Use this procedure when installing Windows NT 4.0 onto
an unused SCSI drive. Windows NT 4.0 automatically adds the driver to the
registry and copies the driver to the appropriate directory.

Choose the appropriate method to install these drivers onto a Windows NT 4.0
system. The two methods are:

o  Boot directly from the Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM
   
   -or-

o  Use Windows NT Boot Floppy Diskettes.

Different steps are required depending on the method used. For Compaq/DEC
systems based on the Alpha processor, CD-ROM installation is the only method
available. The CD-ROM Installation and Boot Floppy Diskette Installation
procedures are listed below. Select the appropriate installation for your
system.


CD-ROM Installation

The driver that is bundled with Windows NT 4.0 is SYMC810.SYS. This driver 
supports controllers that are listed in the "NOTE" above. 

1. Have the Symbios Driver Diskette available for inserting into the
   A: drive when prompted.

Important: Read Steps 2 and 3 before performing the instructions contained
           within these steps.

2. Start the Windows NT 4.0 installation by booting from the Windows NT CD-ROM:

   For Intel-based systems, the system BIOS must support booting from a CD-ROM.
   Symbios BIOS settings may need to be changed to allow CD-ROM booting.

   For Alpha-based systems, select Supplimentary menu from the firmware Boot
   Menu, and then select Install Windows NT from CD-ROM.

3. When the screen displays "Windows NT Setup", press the F6 key. This must be
   done or else the new driver installed from the Symbios Driver diskette will
   not be recognized. 

   Note: Be sure to press the F6 key as any driver loaded later in the
         installation process is not recognized by the Windows setup.
         If F6 is not pressed, all devices controlled by the drivers are 
         not available during Windows NT setup.


4. When the screen displays "Setup could not determine the type of one or more
   mass storage devices...", choose S to specify an additional device. 

   NOTE: If this screen is not displayed as the first user input, then the F6
         keypress was not seen by the setup program. Reboot the system and
         try again.

   The system prompts for the manufacturer-supplied hardware support disk.

5. Insert the appropriate Symbios Driver diskette containing the Windows NT
   driver required to support your Symbios adapter(s) and press Enter. 

      
   NOTE: Current Windows NT 4.0 drivers can be downloaded from the LSI Logic web
         site at URL: http://www.lsilogic.com. After being connected to this
         web site, click on the Support option in the menu bar. Go to the
         "Software and drivers for Symbios brand PCI host adapters" section

           download the appropriate driver based on the selection made.

6. Depending on the driver being installed, either "Symbios PCI (53C8XX)",
   "Symbios PCI High Performance Driver", or "Symbios Ultra3 PCI SCSI Driver"
   is shown highlighted. Press Enter to proceed.

    
   NOTE: If more than one Symbios driver needs to be installed, they can be
         installed one after the other using steps 4 through 6. Installation
         order is not important.

7. Windows NT 4.0 should now recognize the Miniport driver(s) and the SCSI
   hardware. Press Enter to continue. 

   At this point, simply follow the Microsoft Windows NT installation
   procedure.

Boot Floppy Disk Installation

The driver that is bundled with Windows NT 4.0 is SYMC810.SYS. This driver 
supports controllers that are listed in the "NOTE" above.

1. Have the Symbios Driver Diskette available for inserting into the A:
   drive when prompted.

Important: Read Step 2 before performing the instructions contained
           within this step.

2. Start the Windows NT 4.0 installation by booting from the Microsoft Setup
   floppy diskette.

3. Press Enter when the Welcome to Setup screen appears.

   The Windows NT 4.0 Workstation Setup window appears next.

4. Press S to skip automatic detection and do manual selection. A screen
   displays the message "Setup has recognized the following mass storage
   devices in your computer..."
 
5. Choose S to configure additional SCSI adapters when a screen displays
   the SCSI adapters found.

6. Move the highlight bar to Other and press Enter. 

   The system prompts for the manufacturer-supplied hardware support disk.

7. Insert the appropriate Symbios Driver diskette containing the Windows NT
   driver required to support your Symbios adapter(s) and press Enter.

   NOTE: Current Windows NT 4.0 drivers can be downloaded from the LSI Logic web
         site at URL: http://www.lsilogic.com. After being connected to this
         web site, click on the Support option in the menu bar. Go to the
         "Software and drivers for Symbios brand PCI host adapters" section
         and choose the operating system or utility desired. Click on the Go
         button. Based on your selection, you will either:

        A. Download the driver or utility from the next screen,
          
           -or-

        B. Select the chipset or model number of the host adapter card, then
           download the appropriate driver based on the selection made.
  
8.  Depending on the driver being installed, either "Symbios PCI (53C8XX)",
    "Symbios PCI High Performance Driver" or "Symbios Ultra3 PCI SCSI Driver"
    is shown highlighted. Press Enter to proceed.

     NOTE: If more than one Symbios driver needs to be installed, they can be
         installed one after the other using steps 5 through 8. Installation
         order is not important.

9. The Windows NT Workstation Setup window reappears. If using an IDE
    CD-ROM for installation, press S to load additional drives. Another
    window appears. Scroll up and select:

    "IDE CD-ROM (ATAPI 1.2)/PCI IDE Controller"

    Press Enter.

    -or-
   
    If you have completed configuring additional SCSI adapters, press
    Enter.

10. Upon exiting, a screen displays the message "Setup will load support for
    the following mass storage devices(s). Press Enter to continue.  This 
    message implies that Windows NT recognizes the miniport driver and the
    SCSI hardware. 

    At this point, simply follow the Microsoft Windows NT installation 
    procedure.


*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Existing System Installation *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *

This procedure installs the SYMC8XX.SYS, SYM_HI.SYS, or SYM_U3.SYS driver onto
an existing Windows NT system.

NOTE: Windows NT 4.0 uses the Windows 95/98 user interface, resulting in minor 
      changes to the procedure for updating SCSI drivers. 


*   *   * Windows NT 4.0 *   *   *

1. Boot Windows NT 4.0 and log on as Administrator.

2. Click on the Start button. Move to Settings-->Control Panel and click.

3. Double click on SCSI Adapters.

4. Click on the Drivers tab. If NCRSDMS.SYS, NCRC810.SYS, NCRC8XX.SYS, or
   SYMC810.SYS drivers are listed, and you are installing the SYMC8XX driver,
   select the driver(s) and choose Remove before adding the new SYMC8XX driver.
   Also, if the name of the driver you are installing (SYMC8XX.SYS, SYM_HI.SYS,
   or SYM_U3.SYS) is listed, remove it before adding the new driver. Select OK
   when the Remove Driver message prompts, "Are you sure you want to remove
   this driver?". Another message may appear and prompt for a response, "The
   SCSI Adapter has been marked as a boot device ...". If so, click on the OK
   button.

5. Click Add. A list of installed adapters is displayed.

6. Click the Have Disk button.

7. When prompted, insert the appropriate Symbios Driver diskette containing
   the Windows NT 4.0 driver required to support your Symbios adapter(s). For
   the path to copy manufacturer's files from, enter 
  
     A:\WINNT\MINIPORT   

   Select OK. 

8. Depending on the driver being installed, either "Symbios PCI (53C8XX)",
   "Symbios PCI High Performance Driver", or "Symbios Ultra3 PCI SCSI Driver"
   is shown highlighted on the Install Driver menu. If it is not highlighted,
   select it. Choose OK.

   At this point, the following message may occur:

   "The driver(s) for this SCSI Adapter are already on the system. Do you 
   want to use the currently installed driver(s) or install new one(s)?" 

   Selecting Current uses the driver already on the system, and selecting New 
   uses the driver on the floppy diskette. Unless you want to use the older 
   version already on the system, choose New. If you chose Current, go to 
   step 10.

9. For the path to the OEM SCSI Adapter files, A:\WINNT\MINIPORT should be
   displayed. Select Continue. Then remove the floppy diskette from the
   A: drive.

   The System Settings Change message displays "You must restart your computer 
   before the new settings take effect. Do you want to restart your computer 
   now?" 

10.Click on the Yes button to restart and reboot Windows NT 4.0. If you choose
   Cancel, remember that you must restart the computer to load the new driver.

11.If more than one Symbios driver needs to be installed, they can be installed
   one after the other without rebooting for each one. Installation order is
   not important.

12.Reboot your system to load the new miniport driver(s).


*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Performance Tuning for NT 4.0 *  *  *  *  *  *  *

Windows NT 4.0 has registry entries that can be used to improve the performance 
of SCSI I/O for certain configurations. The tunable parameters are large 
transfer block size support and a guaranteed number of concurrent I/Os for a 
particular SCSI bus.


*   *   * Large Block Size Support *   *   *

The SYMC8XX.SYS, SYM_HI.SYS, and SYM_U3.SYS drivers can support up to a 1 Mbyte
transfer size in Windows NT 4.0. However, in Windows NT 4.0, the default
transfer size is 64 Kbytes. To enable a larger transfer size, an entry must be
added to the registry, using the file sym_256K.reg. This file will set a 256
Kbytes maximum, but it can be edited to set other desired maximum transfer
sizes.

Important: Be sure to read the information in the sym_256K.reg data
           file before editing it.
 
Choose one of two methods to add this registry setting:

1. Locate the sym_256K.reg data file (supplied with the driver files) using
   Windows Explorer and double click on the file.
 
   -or-

2. Type at the command prompt:

     regedit sym_256K.reg

This inserts an entry in the registry to enable 256K block size support. 

Editing the sym_256K.reg can set any maximum block size between 64 Kbytes and
1 Mbyte (-8 Kbytes). The formula to calculate the proper value for
MaximumSGList is:

     MaximumSGList = (Maximum Block Size)/4K +1

For 256K: 256K/4K = 64, add 1 for 65 (decimal) or 0x41(hexadecimal). The 
maximum value allowed for MaximumSGLIst is 255 or 0xFF. This denotes an 
absolute maximum transfer size of 1040384, which is 8K less than 1 MB
(1040384/4K = 0xFE, add 1 for 0xFF or 255). 

The system must be rebooted for the new registry setting to be effective.

To reset the maximum block size to the default of 64K, follow the instructions
above, except use symdfblk.reg as the data file.


*  *  *  *  * Maximum Number of Concurrent I/Os (Guaranteed) *  *  *  *  *  *  

Windows NT 4.0 only guarantees a maximum of 32 concurrent I/Os active on a
particular SCSI bus. However, due to the method of memory allocation, the
actual limit of concurrent I/Os can vary greatly between various drivers or
versions of drivers. This can have a huge impact on performance benchmarking
between different driver versions or adapter vendors. In effect, one adapter
may actually be able to have 70 or 80 I/Os outstanding, while another adapter
could only have 32. This can also affect systems with high performance storage
subsystems, such as disk arrays.

In order to have a guaranteed number of concurrent I/Os, an entry must be 
added to the registry, using the file sym100io.reg.

Important: Be sure to read the information in the sym100io.reg data file
           before editing it.

Choose one of two methods to add this registry setting:

1. Locate the sym100io.reg data file (supplied with the driver files) using
   Windows Explorer and double click on the file. 

   -or-

2. Type at the command prompt:

     regedit sym100io.reg

This inserts an entry in the registry to guarantee a maximum of 100 
concurrent I/Os per adapter.

If a maximum other than 100 is desired, the sym100io.reg can be edited.
The system administrator should be aware that increasing the number of
concurrent I/Os from the default of 32 will use increasing amounts of
non-paged pool memory. High values for this setting can degrade system
performance.

The system must be rebooted for the new registry setting to be effective.

To reset the guaranteed number of concurrent I/Os to the default of 32, 
follow the instructions above, except use symdefio.reg as the data file. 


*   *   * Auto Request Sense *   *   *

Enabling and Disabling Auto Request Sense is found in the section titled 
"Troubleshooting."

*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Disk Mirroring *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *

Note: This section applies only to Intel x86-platforms where the Symbios 4.XX 
      PCI SCSI BIOS is used.

Symbios 4.XX PCI SCSI BIOS loads only one image into the system memory at boot 
time regardless of how many host adapters are used in the system. All of the 
disk drives on all host adapters will be recognized through the INT13h function 
call. Because of this implementation, disk mirroring under Windows NT needs to
be done by following instructions which might be different from the Microsoft
documentation.

To create an NT Fault Tolerant (FT) floppy diskette so that you can boot from
the mirrored partition in case the primary partition fails, follow these steps:

1. Format a floppy diskette in drive A: using NT (File Manager or Windows 
   Explorer) for use as a Fault Tolerant boot floppy.

2. From the root directory of the primary partition, copy NTLDR, 
   NTDETECT.COM, and BOOT.INI to this floppy diskette.

3. Temporarily remove the read-only attribute of the BOOT.INI file so that it 
   can be modified and saved.

4. Edit the BOOT.INI file on the FT floppy diskette and modify the following 
   line where you want to boot the mirrored partition:

        multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(x)partition(y)\<winnt_directory>

   where:
    
     multi(0) and disk(0) should always remain same.

     x = the drive number of the mirrored partition in the INT13 chain minus
         80h.

     The drive number of the mirrored partition can be found during system 
     bootup of the Symbios 4.XX PCI SCSI BIOS when the primary partition does
     not exist. It should say either BOOT (=80h), 81h, 82h, and higher. 
     Therefore, the value of x would be 0 when BOOT, 1 when 81h, 2 when 
     82h, etc.

     y = the partition number on the drive (starts at 1 which equals single 
     partition on the drive)

     The next example provides a scenario to better illustrate the above
     information.
   
     EXAMPLE: Two Symbios 8xx host adapters are in the system. 

     The first HBA, HBA #0 which is the boot path, has two SCSI hard drives on 
     ID 0 and ID 5. The second host adapter,HBA #1, has two SCSI hard drives on 
     ID 2 and ID 4. Assuming that the SCSI bus scan starts from ID 0 and goes
     up, the drive number of INT13h will look like this:

       HBA #0, ID 0= BOOT (which is 80h)    
       HBA #0, ID 5= 81h    
       HBA #1, ID 2= 82h    
       HBA #1, ID 4= 83h    

   Now Windows NT 4.0 is installed on the boot drive, HBA #0 ID 0, and a
   mirrored partition is established on HBA #1 ID 2. If the primary partition
   fails, for example due to power failure, then the drive number of INT13h
   will change:

       HBA #0, ID 5= BOOT (which is 80h)   
       HBA #1, ID 2= 81h    
       HBA #1, ID 4= 82h    

   Therefore, the following line should be used in the BOOT.INI file on the NT 
   Fault Tolerant boot floppy to boot from the mirrored partition, HBA #1
   ID 2. Note that rdisk(1) was calculated from x=81h minus 80h.

        multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(1)partition(1)\<winnt_directory> 

6. Save the BOOT.INI and restore the "read-only" attribute.


*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Troubleshooting *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * 

Some potential problems and their suggested solutions are:

*   *   * Problem *   *   *

During installation, no SCSI devices are found.

*   *   * Solution *   *   *

a. Ensure that the custom setup is chosen on the Setup Method screen.

b. Ensure that all devices are powered on and terminated correctly.

c. Check that no devices have duplicate SCSI IDs.

d. Make sure INT A is assigned for the PCI slot(s) where your SCSI host 
   adapter(s) are installed.

e. Ensure that all devices can be seen in the display banner of the SDMS
   SCSI BIOS at boot time.

*   *   * Problem *   *   *

System crashes during installation with a message indicating inaccessible 
boot device.

*   *   * Solution *   *   *

a. This error is usually associated with an IRQ, DMA channel, I/O (chip) 
   address, or BIOS address conflict. Set the SCSI host adapter to use a 
   different interrupt.

b. A virus sometimes causes this error that infects the Master Boot Record 
   of the boot device. Use a write-protected DOS bootable flex containing 
   virus scanning and cleaning software to check for any viruses on the boot 
   device, and remove if any are found.

A disk drive is recognized as seven different devices when only one is 
physically connected to the SCSI bus.

*   *   * Solution *   *   *

a. Older SCSI devices that incorrectly indicate to Windows NT 4.0 that they 
   support multiple LUNs usually cause this error. Contact the device
   manufacturer for a firmware upgrade.

Problems with SCSI devices installation or operation.

*   *   * Solution *   *   *

a. If a SCSI device is not operating properly (either the device is not found 
   or a SCSI interface error occurs during scanning), it is possible that the 
   third-party device drivers do not support the auto request sense feature 
   of Symbios host adapters. Disable the auto request sense feature as 
   described below and try the device operation again.

   Using the file symno_ar.reg (supplied with the Symbios NT driver files),
   either double click the file in Windows Explorer or File Manager or type
   "regedit symno_ar.reg" at the command prompt. This inserts a registry entry
   that disables the auto request sense feature. The system must be rebooted
   for this change to take effect.

   To re-enable the auto request sense feature, use the file "sym_auto.reg"
   and perform one of the update methods described in the preceding paragraph.

Problems with certain SCSI devices when using an Ultra SCSI adapter.

*   *   * Solution *   *   *

a. Some SCSI devices do not function properly when the adapter attempts to 
   negotiate Ultra SCSI transfer rates. If a device is not operating 
   properly, check the transfer speed setting using the SDMS 4.XX PCI SCSI BIOS 
   Configuration Utility (press Ctrl-C when the Symbios PCI BIOS banner appears
   during the system boot process). Devices that do not support Ultra SCSI
   should be set to a maximum of 10 Mbytes/s for 8-bits, and 20 Mbytes/s for
   16-bits.

*   *   * Problem *   *   *

Problems with Ultra SCSI devices using Ultra SCSI protocol.

*   *   * Solution *   *   *

a. If the system is configured with a Symbios host adapter that supports Ultra 
   SCSI and an Ultra SCSI device is on the SCSI bus, intermittent problems and 
   possible system crashes can occur if the SCSI bus cable and terminators do  
   not conform to the Ultra SCSI specification.

b. Disable Ultra SCSI support for all devices via the SDMS 4.XX PCI SCSI BIOS  
   Configuration Utility (press Ctrl-C when the Symbios PCI BIOS banner is 
   displayed during the system boot process).

c. If the system operates properly without Ultra SCSI enabled, it is highly 
   likely that the SCSI bus cable and terminators are not configured 
   correctly for Ultra SCSI. See the Symbios host adapter User's Guide 
   for information on Ultra SCSI cabling requirements.

*   *   * Problem *   *   *

The system hangs at boot, has a long boot time, or SCSI device not available.

Some older SCSI devices do not tolerate Domain Validation operations.  At
system boot time, Domain Validation is performed to test the data integrity of
the SCSI bus between the host adapter and each target device. With some older
SCSI devices, these operations can cause the device to stop responding to SCSI
commands.

*   *   * Solution *   *   *

Disable Domain Validation, either for a specific SCSI target or all adapters
controlled by a specific driver.

a. To disable Domain Validation for a specific SCSI target, use the SDMS 4.XX 
   PCI SCSI BIOS Configuration Utility to set the sync rate to 0 (async) and 
   the data width to 8. This target will be running in async/narrow mode and
   no Domain Validation operations will be performed on it.
  
b. To disable Domain Validation for all host adapters controlled by this
   driver, use the file symno_dv.reg (supplied with the Symbios NT driver 
   files). Either double click on the file in Windows Explorer or File Manager 
   or type "regedit symno_dv.reg" at the command prompt. This inserts a
   registry entry that disables Domain Validation operations. The system must
   be rebooted for this change to take effect.

c. To re-enable the Domain Validation feature, use the file "sym_domv.reg" and
   perform one of the update methods described in the preceding paragraph.
