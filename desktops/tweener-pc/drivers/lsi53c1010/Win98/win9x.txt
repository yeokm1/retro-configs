*********************** Introduction for Windows 95/98 *********************** 

Windows 95/98 is an operating system designed to run on Intel processors
using current technology. It provides a graphical user interface environment 
incorporating many high-level features. Refer to the Microsoft Windows 95/98 
documentation for details.


An I/O manager handles I/O requests in Windows 95/98. To address a SCSI
peripheral, the I/O manager goes through the appropriate drivers. Class drivers
for hard disk, floptical, CD-ROM, printer, and scanner peripherals are provided
in Windows 95/98. Other class drivers, provided by peripheral manufacturers,
are added to support new devices.

LSI Logic and Microsoft provide miniport drivers, called SYMC8XX.MPD,
SYM_HI.MPD, and SYM_U3.MPD to complete the path to a Symbios controller or
processor with an optional SDMS SCSI BIOS. The following sections describe
these drivers and their installation.


*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Features *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * 

The Symbios miniport drivers support these features:

o  Ultra160 data transfers (for devices that support this feature)
o  Domain Validation
o  Synchronous negotiation (including Fast/Ultra SCSI/Ultra2 SCSI) 
o  Wide negotiation 
o  Auto Request Sense 
o  Multiple host adapters 
o  Multiple Logical Unit Numbers (LUNs) 
o  Disconnect/Reselect 
o  Scatter/Gather 
o  Differential Support 
o  SCSI pass-through functionality 
o  SCAM Support (SCSI Configured AutoMatically) 
o  Target initiated negotiation support 
o  NVRAM support (wide/sync parameters, SCSI Host ID, SCAM ON/OFF) 


*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  Symbios Devices Supported *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * 

The SYMC8XX.MPD driver supports the following devices and Symbios host adapters
based on those devices:

o  SYM53C810, SYM53C810A, SYM53C810AE (SYM8100S, SYM8100ASP, SYM20810)
o  SYM53C815 (SYM815XS, SYM8150SP)
o  SYM53C825, SYM53C825A (SYM8250S, SYM8251S, SYM8251D, SYM8250ASP, SYM8251ASP,
   SYM8251AD)
o  SYM53C860, SYM53C860AE (SYM8600SP, SYM20860)
o  SYM53C875, SYM53C875E (SYM8750SP, SYM8751SP, SYM8751SPE, SYM8751D)

*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Description *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *

SYMC8XX.MPD, SYM_HI.MPD, and SYM_U3.MPD are designed to the Microsoft speci-
fication for miniport drivers. These drivers allow connection of SCSI devices
including disk drives, CD-ROMs, and tape drives for PCI-based machines. To
support a new SCSI device, the Windows 95/98 architecture requires that a class
driver for that type device is present (usually supplied by Microsoft, or
possibly by the peripheral manufacturer). No changes to SYMC8XX.MPD,
SYM_HI.MPD, or SYM_U3.MPD are required. These drivers are only supported under
Windows 95/98.

SCSI commands are passed directly from a Windows application to the SCSI 
devices by using the SCSI pass-through facility (refer to Microsoft
Windows 95/98 documentation for details). This facility allows applications to 
directly control and access SCSI devices by filling in a data structure and 
calling in to the port driver.

The SYMC8XX.MPD and SYM_HI.MPD drivers support Ultra SCSI protocol, providing
twice the raw data transfer rate of Fast SCSI for disk drives and Symbios host 
adapters that support Ultra SCSI. These drivers also support Ultra2 SCSI
protocol, providing quadruple the raw data transfer rate of Fast SCSI. The
SYM_U3.MPD driver supports Ultra160 SCSI protocol providing 80 Mbytes/s of data
transfer and up to 160 Mbytes/s data transfer for double transition.

Caution: Ultra SCSI requires more stringent SCSI bus cabling setups than 
         Fast SCSI. Ultra2 and Ultra160 SCSI require Low-Voltage Differential
         (LVD) termination.


*********** Installing Your SYMC8XX.MPD/SYM_HI.MPD/SYM_U3.MPD Driver ********** 

*  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Preparing a Symbios Driver Diskette *  *  *  *  *  * 

Copy the files listed below for the appropriate driver (supplied to you on
distribution media) to the root directory of a clean floppy diskette, and use
this Symbios Driver diskette during installation.

For the SYMC8XX.MPD driver: SYMC8XX.MPD   
                            SYMC8XX.INF   

For the SYM_HI.MPD driver:  SYM_HI.MPD   
                            SYM_HI.INF

For the SYM_U3.MPD driver:  SYM_U3.MPD
                            SYM_U3.INF   


*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  New System Installation *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *

This procedure installs the SYMC8XX.MPD, SYM_HI.MPD, or SYM_U3.MPD driver onto
a Windows 95/98 system for all new system installations. Use this procedure
when initially upgrading to Windows 95/98. Windows 95/98 automatically adds the
driver to the registry and copies the driver to the appropriate directories.

NOTE: Some Symbios PCI SCSI host adapters are supported by a driver 
      bundled in Windows 95/98. For these adapters, the bundled driver is 
      automatically installed during Windows 95/98 Setup. To change to the 
      newer SYMC8XX.MPD, SYM_HI.MPD or SYM_U3.MPD driver, follow the
      instructions under "Existing System Installation" after the 
      Windows 95/98 installation has completed.

1. Start the Windows 95/98 Setup according to the Microsoft instructions.

2. Setup enters the hardware detection phase after a system reboot. The
   "Setting up Hardware" message box appears. If the message "Symbios PCI 
   SCSI Host Adapter" appears, then the host adapter supports the bundled 
   driver, and it installs automatically. After the Windows 95/98 installation 
   has completed, the user can install the SYMC8XX.MPD, SYM_HI.MPD, and/or
   SYM_U3.MPD drivers according to the "Existing System Installation" 
   instructions.

3. If the bundled driver does not support the host adapter, Setup displays 
   a New Hardware Found - PCI SCSI Bus Controller dialog box. Select "Driver 
   from disk provided by hardware manufacturer" and click OK.

   Note: If ASPI8XX.SYS (the Symbios SDMS 4.0 DOS ASPI driver) is loaded 
         when beginning the Windows 95/98 installation, no messages about 
         PCI SCSI Bus Controllers will appear. The installation completes,
         but real-mode disk drivers are used. See the section below on 
         "Verifying Correct Driver Installation." To install the SYMC8XX.MPD,
         SYM_HI.MPD, and/or SYM_U3.MPD drivers, (which disable loading of the
         ASPI8XX.SYS driver under Windows 95/98) see the section on "Existing
         System Using ASPI8XX.SYS DOS ASPI Driver" below. 

4. Insert the Symbios Driver diskette into drive A: (or B:) (the one prepared 
   in * Preparing a Symbios Driver Diskette *) and click OK. If using drive 
   B:, you must select it from the pick list.

   Windows 95/98 automatically copies the appropriate driver files and rebuilds 
   its driver database.

   A "System Settings Change" dialog box appears.

5. Remove the diskette from the drive and click Yes to restart the computer.

At this point, Windows 95/98 Setup has completed, and the new driver is
operational. To verify this, see the section "Verifying Correct Driver
Installation."

*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Troubleshooting *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *

Some problems and their suggested solutions are:

*   *   * Problem *   *   *

During Installation, No SCSI Devices Are Found.

*   *   * Solution *   *   *

a. Ensure that all devices are powered on and terminated correctly.

b. Check that no devices have duplicate SCSI IDs.

c. Make sure INT A is assigned for the PCI slot(s) where your SCSI host 
   adapter(s) are installed.

d. Be sure that all devices appear properly in the display banner of the
   SDMS SCSI BIOS at boot time.

*   *   * Problem *   *   *

Problems With Ultra SCSI Devices Using Ultra SCSI Protocol.

*   *   * Solution *   *   *

a. If the system is configured with a Symbios host adapter that 
   supports Ultra SCSI, an Ultra SCSI device is on the SCSI bus, and Ultra 
   SCSI support by the SYMC8XX.MPD or SYM_HI.MPD driver is enabled,
   intermittent problems and possible system crashes can occur if the SCSI
   bus cable and terminators do not conform to the Ultra SCSI specification. 

b. If the system is bootable, disable Ultra SCSI support using the procedure 
   described below.

c. If the system is not bootable to Windows 95/98, hold down the F8 key when
   Starting Windows 95/98... appears on the screen. At the menu, select Safe
   Mode. Once the system is booted, disable Ultra SCSI support using the
   procedure described in the Command Line Options section titled "Enabling/
   Disabling Ultra SCSI Support." 

d. If the system operates properly without Ultra SCSI enabled, it is highly 
   likely that the SCSI bus cable and terminators are not configured 
   correctly for Ultra SCSI. See the Symbios host adapter hardware 
   manual for information on Ultra SCSI cabling requirements.

e. Verify that the devices appear with the proper value for speed in the SDMS
   SCSI BIOS banner at boot time. Please see Chapter 2  "SCSI BIOS" in the 
   Symbios PCI SCSI/Storage Device Management System SDMS 4.0 User's Guide for
   additional details.

*   *   * Problem *   *   *

Problems With Scanners.

a. If a scanner is not operating properly (either the scanner is not found or 
   a SCSI interface error occurs during scanning), it is possible that the 
   third-party scanner drivers do not support the auto request sense feature 
   of Symbios host adapters. Disable the auto request sense feature and try
   the scanner operation again. Use the procedure described in the Command
   Lines Options section titled "Disabling Auto Request Sense Support."

*   *   * Problem *   *   *

The system hangs at boot, has a long boot time, or SCSI device not available.

Some older SCSI devices do not tolerate Domain Validation operations.  At
system boot time, Domain Validation is performed to test the data integrity of
the SCSI bus between the host adapter and each target device.  With some older
SCSI devices, these operations can cause the device to stop responding to SCSI
commands.

*   *   * Solution *   *   *

Disable Domain Validation support as described below, either for a specific
problem SCSI target or all adapters controlled by the SYMC8XX.MPD, SYM_HI.MPD,
or SYM_U3.MPD driver. Refer to the procedure in the Command Line Options
section titled "Disabling Domain Validation Support.

**************************** Command Line Options ****************************

The command line options are described below. 

*  *  *  *  *  * Enabling/Disabling Ultra SCSI Support *  *  *  * 

Ultra SCSI support is controlled by settings in the adapter NVRAM. 
These settings can be viewed or changed using the SCSI BIOS Configuration
Utility. During system boot, after the Symbios PCI BIOS banner, the message
"Press Ctrl-C to start Configuration Utility" appears for a few seconds.
Press Ctrl-C to start this utility.  

Select one of the adapters displayed, then "Device Selections". This shows 
the Sync Rate for each device and the selected adapter. To set a device to 
Ultra, the speed should be set to 20 Mbytes/s (for width of 8) or 40 Mbytes/s
(for width of 16). To disable Ultra, the speed should be no higher than
10 Mbytes/s (for width of 8) or 20 Mbytes/s (for width of 16). If the speed of
the adapter itself is changed, the speed for all devices will be set no higher
than the adapter speed.


*  *  *   *  *  *  * Disabling Auto Request Sense Support *  *  *  *  *  *  * 

When the SYMC8XX.MPD, SYM_HI.MPD and/or SYM_U3.MPD drivers are installed, 
support for auto request sense is enabled. Auto request sense is a feature of
the adapter where certain device information is obtained automatically without
system control, thereby increasing overall performance. However, some
third-party peripheral drivers do not support the use of auto request sense,
resulting in perceived device failures. Therefore, to allow these devices to
operate properly, the auto request sense feature can be disabled using the
Device Manager on a per adapter basis.

Use this procedure for disabling auto request sense support:

1. Click on the Start button. Select Settings-->Control Panel.

2. Double click on the System icon. 

3. Click on the Device Manager tab.

4. Either double click on the SCSI controllers entry, or click once on the 
   plus sign to the left of it. 

   One entry for each host adapter installed in the system appears.

5. Select the adapter desired, then click on the Properties button.

6. Click the Settings tab.

7. In the Adapter settings entry, type "DisableAutoReqSense=1;", without 
   the quotes. 
   
   If there is already an entry displayed, type the above at the end of the
   existing entry. Be sure to include the semicolon.

8. Click OK to exit the Settings tab.

9. Click OK again.

   If the entry was changed, the "System Settings Change" dialog box appears.

10 Click Yes to restart the computer.

After the system reboots, auto request sense is disabled for the 
selected adapter. To re-enable auto request sense, delete the entry that was 
made above. If other entries exist, be sure to leave them intact.


*  *  *  * Disabling Domain Validation Support *  *  *  * 

When the SYMC8XX.MPD, SYM_HI.MPD, or SYM_U3.MPD driver is installed, support
for domain validation is enabled. Domain validation is a feature of the adapter
where the data transfer speed between the adapter and each target is tested at
system boot. If the test fails, the data transfer speed is reduced and the test
repeated until a supported data transfer speed is found. However, some older
SCSI devices do not properly support the standard SCSI commands used during
this testing, resulting in the system not booting or a device not available.
Therefore, to allow these devices to operate properly, the domain validation
feature can be disabled using the Device Manager for all adapters controlled by
the respective driver, or in the PCI SCSI BIOS Configuration Utility on a per
device basis.

Use this procedure for disabling domain validation support for all adapters
controlled by the SYMC8XX.MPD, SYM_HI.MPD, or SYM_U3.MPD driver:

1. Click on the Start button. Select Settings-->Control Panel.

2. Double click on the System icon.

3. Click on the Device Manager tab.

4. Either double click on the SCSI controllers entry, or click once on the 
   plus sign to the left of it. 

   One entry for each host adapter installed in the system appears.

5. Select any adapter controlled by the desired driver, then click on the
   Properties button. 

6. Click on the Settings tab.

7. In the Adapter settings entry, type "DisableDomainValidation=1;", without 
   the quotes. 

   If there is already an entry displayed, type the above at the end of the
   existing entry. Be sure to include the semicolon.

8. Click OK to exit from the Settings tab.

9. Click OK again. 

   If the entry was changed, the "System Settings Change" dialog box appears.

10 Click Yes to restart the computer.

After the system reboots, domain validation is disabled for adapters controlled
by the selected driver. To re-enable domain validation, delete the entry that
was made above. If other entries exist, be sure to leave them intact.


Use this procedure for disabling domain validation support for a selected
device, using the PCI SCSI BIOS Configuration Utility:
 
1. During system boot, after the Symbios PCI BIOS banner, the message "Press
   Ctrl-C to start Configuration Utility" appears for a few seconds.
   Press Ctrl-C to start this utility.

2. Select the desired adapter and press Enter, then choose "Device Selections",
   and press Enter. This shows the Sync Rate and Width for each device and the
   selected adapter.

3. To disable domain validation for a selected device, set the Sync Rate to 0
   and Width to 0 for that device. This sets the device to asynchronous/narrow
   transfers and domain validation functions are not issued to this device.

4. Exit the SCSI BIOS Configuration Utility and save changes.


*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Enabling SCAM Support *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *

SCAM (SCSI Configured AutoMatically) is a protocol that allows SCAM-compliant 
peripherals to assign their SCSI IDs dynamically at boot time, thus eliminating 
the need for the user to check and set unique SCSI IDs. This feature is 
disabled by default in the Symbios PCI BIOS (version 4.14 or earlier) and the
SYMC8XX.MPD, SYM_HI.MPD, and SYM_U3.MPD drivers. Some legacy (non-SCAM)
peripherals have problems with the SCAM protocol, resulting in the device 
either not being seen by the operating system, or not working correctly. 
However, if usage of the SCAM protocol is desired, there are two methods for 
enabling SCAM: Method 1 and Method 2. 


*   *   * Method 1 *   *   *

Use this method when the adapter has NVRAM. During system boot, after the 
Symbios PCI BIOS banner, the message "Press Ctrl-C to start Configuration
Utility" appears for a few seconds. Press Ctrl-C to start this utility.

Select the desired adapter, then choose "Adapter Setup". On the Adapter Setup
Menu, highlight "S-SCAM Support" and press Enter. Use the up/down arrows to
select the ON setting, and press Enter. Exit from the menus and save the
settings. This turns SCAM ON for both the PCI BIOS and the SYMC8XX.MPD,
SYM_HI.MPD, or SYM_U3.MPD driver (whichever is controlling the selected
adapter). To disable SCAM, repeat the above procedure to change the setting
to OFF. 

*   *   * Method 2 *   *    *

For adapters that do not have NVRAM, SCAM can be enabled within Windows 95/98: 

1. Click on the Start button. Select Settings-->Control Panel.
   Double click on the System icon. Click on the Device Manager tab.

2. Either double click on the SCSI controllers entry, or click once on the 
   plus sign to the left of it. One entry for each host adapter installed in 
   the system is displayed. Select the adapter desired, then click on the 
   Properties button. Click on the Settings tab. 

3. In the Adapter settings entry, type in "do_SCAM=1;", without the quotes. If 
   an entry is already displayed, type the above at the end of the existing 
   entry. Be sure to include the semicolon. 

4. Click OK to exit the Settings tab.

5. Click OK again. If the entry was changed, the "System Settings Change" 
   dialog box appears. Click Yes to restart the computer.

After the system reboots, SCAM is enabled for the selected adapter. To 
disable SCAM, delete the entry that was made above. If other entries exist, 
be sure to leave them intact.


*  *  *  *  *  * Multiple Symbios Host Adapter Considerations *  *  *  *  *  *

If multiple Symbios PCI SCSI host adapters are installed in the system, special
actions are sometimes required to install or change drivers. This is due to the
fact that some Symbios host adapters are supported by the bundled driver, and
also that one Symbios driver can support multiple Symbios host adapters
installed in the system.

With multiple Symbios adapters, it is possible to have a situation where one 
adapter is assigned to one driver, and another adapter is assigned to a
different version of the same driver. This can cause conflicts that may cause
the system to switch to real mode drivers, affecting performance and access to
CD-ROM or tape drives.

When installing additional boards or updating drivers, two methods are
available for ensuring that all Symbios host adapters are controlled by only 
one version of the appropriate driver.

*   *   * Method 1 *   *   *

Using the Device Manager, change the driver for a particular host adapter to 
the desired driver. When asked to reboot the system for the new settings 
to take effect, click No. Change drivers for all Symbios host adapters 
in the system supported by that same driver to the new driver, and reply No to
rebooting until the final adapter is changed. If booting from a SCSI device,
ensure that the adapter controlling this device is the last one changed.

*   *   * Method 2 *   *   *

Determine which driver file is active for all adapters through the Properties 
tab in Device Manager. Go to the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM\IOSUBSYS directory and 
rename the driver file to an extension other than MPD. Reboot the system.
 
While booting, the system may ask to load the bundled driver file from the 
Windows 95/98 installation disk. Click OK. When the system says it cannot 
find the file, click Skip File. Do this for all adapter messages while 
booting. After the system is booted, use the Device Manager to change the 
driver for each adapter to the desired driver. Do NOT reply Yes to reboot the 
system until the final adapter has been changed.
