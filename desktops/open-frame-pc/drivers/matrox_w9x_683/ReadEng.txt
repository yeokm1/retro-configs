Description of this release
===========================

Matrox PowerDesk software includes a display driver and display 
utilities. With this software, you can take full advantage of your 
Matrox graphics hardware and you can access additional Matrox 
display-related features.


Installation
============

To install Matrox PowerDesk, start the "Setup" program included 
with it, then follow the on-screen instructions.

The setup program will only install software if a Matrox graphics 
card model supported by the setup program is installed in your 
computer.


New features
============

This software includes new features, especially for Matrox 
hardware with DualHead support. These include:

- The use of different DualHead features (Multi-Display, DVDMax, 
  Zoom, and Clone) *without* restarting Windows

- Easier-to-use interface for DualHead controls

- Controls for dividing graphics resources (memory and bandwidth) 
  between your main and secondary displays

- More features accessible through user-defined hot keys (keyboard 
  shortcuts)


More information
================

For more information on Matrox PowerDesk, see the help file 
included with it. For information specific to your Matrox graphics 
card, see your Matrox or system manual.


Notes, problems, and limitations
================================

- Installation in different language versions of Windows

  If you install software in a language different from the 
  language of your operating system (for example, English software 
  on a Japanese system), you may have problems with text and 
  dialog box controls being cut off. This is because of 
  differences in system fonts.

- OpenGL (3D) support

  If you have a newer Matrox product or your Matrox software was 
  provided by the manufacturer of your computer, full OpenGL 
  support may be disabled with your Matrox display driver. For a 
  Matrox display driver with full OpenGL support enabled, see the 
  Matrox Web site (www.matrox.com/mga). (If your Matrox product 
  was provided by the manufacturer of your computer, check the Web 
  site of that manufacturer for a display driver. A display driver 
  provided by the manufacturer of your computer is more likely to 
  be tested with your computer model.)
