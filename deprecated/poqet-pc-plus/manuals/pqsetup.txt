Revision 3.052-a
July 6, 1994

This document describes the Poqet System Setup Utility (PQSETUP), version 3.02
that is part of release 3.052 of the Plus Series System Software.

In usage syntax descriptions, optional arguments for the utilities are
enclosed in brackets ("[" and "]"). 

The Poqet System Setup Utility (PQSETUP) will change various system
parameters, including power management settings and serial port
configurations.  

The command line syntax of PQSETUP is: 

PQSETUP [/?] [/F] [/K=country] [/V=video] [/P=power_mode] [/O=off_timer] 
        [/B=x;y;z] [/A=x;y;z] [/C=x;y;z] [/M=backlight] [/L=bl_timer] 
        [/R=port_config] [/S=cpu_speed] [/X=access_code] [/E=serial_mode] 

These options are described  in detail below. 

/?             If no option is specified or the "/?" option is used, 
or             PQSETUP will display a brief description of all the commands 
"no options"   and options that can be specified for PQSETUP.

/F             The "/F" option will reset the system settings to the 
               factory defaults.

/K=country     The "/K" option sets the default system country code to 
               <country>. See the Plus Series Technical Reference Guide for 
               a list of valid country codes.

               Default: country = 00 (USA)
               
               Example: "PQSETUP /K=01" sets the country code to the United 
                        Kingdom.

/V=video       The "/V" option sets the default video adapter to either CGA 
               or MDA.  If <video> is "C" then the default video adapter will 
               be the CGA-compatible adapter.  If <video> is "M" then the 
               MDA-compatible adapter will be used.

               Default: video = C (CGA mode)

               Example: "PQSETUP /V=M" sets the default video adapter to 
                        MDA-compatible.

/P=power_mode  The "/P" option sets the default power management (PM) mode to 
               that specified by <power_mode>.  Common values for <power_mode>
               are "00" (PM off), "02" (PM on), and "82" (communications mode).
               See the Plus Series Technical Reference Guide for a complete 
               list of valid power management modes.

               Default: power_mode = 02 (PM on)

               Example: "PQSETUP /P=00" turns power management off.

/O=off_timer   The "/O" option sets the power down timer to the value specified
               by <off_timer>.  <Off_timer> specifies the number of "power 
               management ticks" that must elapse before the system will 
               auto-suspend when the system is idle and power management is 
               active.  A power management tick is 27.5 msec.  The value of 
               <off_timer> is hexadecimal, and can range from 0000 to FFFF.

               Default: off_timer = 2228 (4 minutes)

               Example: "PQSETUP /O=088A" will set the auto-suspend timer to 
               1 minute.

/B= x;y;z      The "/B" option sets the search order for a DOS boot drive.
               The values <x>, <y>, and <z> can be any of the Plus Series 
               drive letters: "A", "B", "C", or "D".

               Default: C;C;C (the system will always boot from drive C:)

               Example: "PQSETUP /B=A;B;C" will set the system to boot from 
                        drive A:.  If there is no card in drive A:, then the 
                        system will boot from drive B:.  If there is no card 
                        in drive B:, then the system will boot from drive C:.

/A=x;y;z       The "/A" option sets the search order for AUTOEXEC.BAT.  
               The values <x>, <y>, and <z> can be any of the Plus Series 
               drive letters: "A", "B", "C", or "D".

               Default: A;D;C (the system will search for AUTOEXEC.BAT first 
                        on drive A:, then on drive D:, then on drive C:)

               Example: "PQSETUP /A=A;B;C" will set the system to search for 
                        AUTOEXEC.BAT on drive A:.  If there is no AUTOEXEC.BAT 
                        on drive A:, then the system will look on drive B:.  
                        If it is not found on drive B:, then the system will 
                        look on drive C:.

/C=x;y;z       The "/C" option sets the search order for CONFIG.SYS.  The 
               values <x>, <y>, and <z> can be any of the Plus Series drive 
               letters: "A", "B", "C", or "D".

               Default: A;D;C (the system will search for CONFIG.SYS first on 
                        drive A:, then on drive D:, then on drive C:)

               Example: "PQSETUP /C=A;B;C" will set the system to search for 
                        CONFIG.SYS on drive A:.  If there is no CONFIG.SYS on 
                        drive A:, then the system will look on drive B:.  If 
                        it is not found on drive B:, then the system will 
                        look on drive C:.

/M=backlight   The "/M" option turns the backlight either on or off, and will 
               change the default backlight setting when the system boots or 
               is resumed from standby mode (with the green On/Off button). 
               If <backlight> is "00", then the backlight will turn off and 
               will be off when the system is resumed.  If <backlight> is 
               "01", then the backlight will be turned on, and it will be on 
               when the system is resumed.

               Default: backlight = 00 (backlight off)

               Example: "PQSETUP /M=01" will turn the backlight on, and set 
                        the system default so that the backlight will be on 
                        whenever the system boots up or is resumed.

/L=bl_timer    The "/L" option sets the backlight-off timer to the value 
               specified by <bl_timer>.   <bl_timer> specifies the number of 
               "power management ticks" that must elapse before the backlight 
               will be shut off (if it is on) when the system is idle and 
               power management is active.  One power management tick is 
               27.5 msec.  The value of <bl_timer> is hexadecimal, and can
               range from 0000 to FFFF.

               Default: bl_timer = 2228 (4 minutes)

               Example: "PQSETUP /L=088A" will set the backlight-off timer 
                        to 1 minute.

/R=port_config The "/R" option configures the serial port hardware in a Plus 
               Series product.  The parameter <port_config> specifies the 
               actual configuration of the serial port hardware.

               <Port_config> consists of two letters and two numbers, in the 
               format "xynm", where:

               a) x specifies where device #1 will be directed, and y 
                  specifies where device #2 will be directed.  x can be:
                  D: device 1 is disabled
                  I: device 1 directed to infrared serial port (PoqetPad 
                     Plus only)
                  R: device 1 directed to RS-232 port
                  T: device 1 directed to TTL serial port

                  y can be:
                  D: device 2 is disabled
                  I: device 2 directed to infrared serial port (PoqetPad 
                     Plus only)
                  B: device 2 directed to barcode reader port
                  T: device 2 directed to TTL serial port

                  Valid combinations of x and y are "DD", "DI", "DB", "RD", 
                  "TD", "RI", "TB","IB", and "RT". 

                  A dash ("-") preceding either device identifier indicates 
                  that the corresponding device will have its polarity 
                  inverted.  This option is only valid with the barcode 
                  reader (B), infrared (I), and TTL (T) devices only.

               b) n specifies which communications port (COM1: or COM2) will 
                  be used for the first enabled device. "1" specifies COM1: 
                  and "2" specifies COM2:.  The second enabled device will 
                  use the other communications port.

               c) m specifies which hardware interrupt, or IRQ, will be used 
                  by the comm port specified by the n parameter.  The valid 
                  options are "3" (specifying IRQ3) and "4" (specifying IRQ4).
                  The IBM-PC/XT standard specifies that COM1: should use IRQ4 
                  and COM2: should use IRQ3.

               If both serial ports are to be disabled, the m and n parameters 
               do not need to be specified, so you can simply issue the 
               command "PQSETUP /R=DD".

               Default:  port_config = RD14 (COM1: is a standard RS-232 serial 
                         port using IRQ4, and COM2: is disabled).

               Examples: If you want to connect an inverted polarity barcode 
                         reader  on COM1:, you would issue the command
                             PQSETUP /R=D-B14

                         Note that the IRQ number must be specified, even 
                         though it conforms to the IBM-PC standard.  Note also 
                         that even though the "B" specifying the barcode 
                         reader is the second device specified, it is put on 
                         COM1: because the "1" that specifies COM1: refers to 
                         the first enabled device, which happens to be the 
                         barcode reader.  

                         To put an inverted polarity barcode reader on COM1:, 
                         and the infrared port on COM2:, the command would be
                              PQSETUP /R=I-B23

/S=cpu_speed   The "/S" option specifies the maximum clock frequency at which 
               power management will allow the system to run. The parameter 
               <cpu_speed> specifies the frequency as follows:  

               cpu_speed    maximum clock frequency
                   0                2 Mhz
                   1                4 Mhz
                   2                8 Mhz
                   3               16 Mhz
 
               Default: cpu_speed = 3 (maximum clock frequency is 16 Mhz)

               Example: "PQSETUP /S=2" sets the max. clock speed to 8 MHz.

/X=access_code The "/X" option enables or disables access to the pop-up 
               configuration utility through the on-screen button on the 
               PoqetPad Plus or the hotkey sequence (Fn+ESC) on the Poqet PC 
               Plus (or a Poqet Pad Plus with a keyboard).  The "/X" option 
               also controls whether the user has the ability to modify the 
               power management settings through the use of the on-screen 
               button on the PoqetPad Plus or the hotkey sequence (Fn+F2) on 
               the Poqet PC Plus or the PoqetPad Plus with a keyboard.

               The parameter <access_code> specifies which kinds of access are 
               to be allowed or disallowed.  <Access_code> consists of two 
               letters the format "xy" where:

               a) x specifies whether you want to enable or disable the 
                  option; x can be one of:
                  E: enable option
                  D: disable option

               b) y specifies the option you want to affect;  y can be one of:
                  P: enable/disable the ability to modify power management 
                     settings
                  S: enable/disable the ability to invoke pop-up configuration 
                     utility
                  B: enable/disable the ability to modify power management 
                     settings and to invoke the pop-up configuration utility

               Default: access_code = EB (power management can be changed, 
                        and the pop-up configurator can be accessed)

               Example: "PQSETUP /X=DP" will keep the user from modifying 
                        the power management settings.

/E=serial_mode The "/E" option controls the status of the incoming modem 
               control signals when one of the communications ports is 
               configured for the barcode reader port or the infrared port.
               The parameter <serial_mode> specifies the polarity of the 
               modem control signals Carrier Detect (CD), Clear To Send 
               (CTS), and Data Set Ready (DSR).  If <serial_mode> is "00" 
               then the modem control signals will be inactive.  If 
               <serial_mode> is "01" then the modem control signals will 
               be active.

               Default: serial_mode = 00 (the modem control signals are 
                        inactive)

               Example: "PQSETUP /E=01" will set the CD, CTS, and DSR signals 
                        to their active state when the barcode reader port or 
                        infrared port is in use.

               This option is effective only on certain hardware revisions of 
               the Plus Series Products.
