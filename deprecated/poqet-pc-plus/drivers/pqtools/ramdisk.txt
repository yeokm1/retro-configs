Revision 3.052-a
July 6, 1994

This document describes the Poqet RAM Disk Driver (RAMDISK) version 0.7 
that is part of release 3.052 of the Plus Series System Software.

In usage syntax descriptions, optional arguments for the utilities are
enclosed in brackets ("[" and "]"). 

The Poqet RAM Disk Driver (RAMDISK) allocates extended memory and creates a
DOS "disk drive" that can be accessed as drive E:.  RAMDISK is loaded as a
device driver in CONFIG.SYS. 

Usage:         DEVICE=[path]RAMDISK.SYS [size]

Parameters:    path:   The DOS pathname that specifies RAMDISK.SYS is 
                       located.  This is usually "D:\".
               size:   The size, in kilobytes, of the RAM disk to create.  
                       This number must be a multiple of 32K.  If omitted, 
                       RAMDISK will create a 32K RAM disk.

Notes:         The drive created by RAMDISK is non-volatile, in that it 
               will survive a warm boot (Ctl-Alt-Del) as well as a hard 
               reset.  The contents of the RAM disk will be lost if one 
               of the two events occur:
               1) The size of the RAM disk is changed, or
               2) All power is lost in the system (both the main battery 
                  and the bridge battery discharge completely). 

               The maximum size of a RAM disk created with RAMDISK is 1344K.

               RAMDISK must precede PQEMM in CONFIG.SYS.  RAMDISK and 
               PQEMM share memory, so any memory left over by RAMDISK 
               is available to PQEMM.

Example:       To create a 320K RAM disk, accessible as drive E:, 
               place the following command line in CONFIG.SYS:
                   DEVICE=D:\RAMDISK.SYS 320
