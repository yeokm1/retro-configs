Revision 3.052-a
July 6, 1994

This document describes the Poqet Plus Expanded Memxory Manager (PQEMM)
version 1.04 that is part of release 3.052 of the Plus Series System Software.

In usage syntax descriptions, optional arguments for the utilities are
enclosed in brackets ("[" and "]"). 

The Poqet Plus Expanded Memory Manager (PQEMM) provides expanded memory
support compatible with the Lotus/Intel/Microsoft (LIM) 4.0 Expanded Memory
Specification, with some limitations.  These limitations are explained fully
in Chapter 2 of the Poqet Plus Series Technical Reference.  PQEMM is loaded
as a device driver in CONFIG.SYS. 

Usage:         DEVICE=[path]PQEMM.SYS [/n:size]

Parameters:    path:   The DOS pathname that specifies RAMDISK.SYS is 
                       located.  This is usually "D:\".

               size:   The size, in kilobytes, of the amount of memory 
                       that PQEMM is to manage.  This amount of expanded 
                       memory is automatically rounded up to the next 16K 
                       page.  So, for instance, if you issue the command 
                            DEVICE=D:\PQEMM.SYS /n:500
                       PQEMM will allocate and manage 512K of expanded memory.
 
                       If the size parameter is omitted, PQEMM will allocate 
                       all available RAM for expanded memory.

Notes:         The maximum amount of memory available to PQEMM is 1344 KB, 
               minus any RAM used by RAMDISK.
         
               PQEMM must be loaded after RAMDISK.  RAMDISK and PQEMM share 
               memory, so PQEMM can only manage memory left over by RAMDISK.

Example:       To create 1 MB (1024K) of expanded memory managed by PQEMM, 
               place the following command line in CONFIG.SYS:
                    DEVICE=D:\PQEMM.SYS /n:1024
