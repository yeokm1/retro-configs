workmanship and will perform in substantial compliance with your user
documentation accompanying the Products for as long as you own and properly use
the Products.
<h3>Software</h3>
Software accompanying these Products (including driver, utility software, etc.)
and the magnetic or optical media containing the software are warranted to
perform in substantial compliance with the specifications contained in your user
documentation for two years from your purchase date. Our warranty does not cover
or provide you with rights to upgrades or updates.
<p>You are responsible for your choice of applications programs or related
reference materials. Given the wide range of third party hardware and
applications software products you might use our software with, you understand
that Xircom does not warrant the compatibility or the uninterrupted or error
free operation of our software.
<p>Upon our confirmation of a covered defect or failure, at our option we will
repair or replace the affected item or will refund your purchase price if repair
or replacement is not possible or practical. At our option, replacement products
or repaired items may be a new, refurbished, or functionally equivalent item.
Our warranty on items serviced under warranty will be lifetime for hardware and,
for software, 90 days from return to you of software/magnetic media or the
remainder of the original warranty, whichever is longer. Repair, replacement, or
refund are the exclusive remedies available to you from Xircom for products and
software.
